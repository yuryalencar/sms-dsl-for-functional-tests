abstract = {When it comes to web services, RESTful web APIs have become the de facto standard since 2000. Those APIs expose back-end data, so it is crucial that they are robust, secure, and reliable to keep sensitive data protected. Although existing tools for automating APIs test case generation have shown significant potential, they are limited in their applicability since they focus solely on random inputs through fuzzing. Using only API specifications, it is impractical to describe personalized and specific test case workflows. This paper introduces RapiTest, an open-source continuous black-box testing application for RESTful web APIs. It takes advantage of the API specification to automatically generate tests, but also makes use of a new DSL named Test Specification Language (TSL), to create rich test cases. The RapiTest web application allows the setup of several predefined verifications, regarding security and correctness of the responses, while running the tests at regular intervals, such as every 24 hours. In this way, the API can be monitored continuously to ensure it is running correctly.}

The aim is not so much to check the defined requirements but to ensure that the software satisfies the customer’s needs. Agile methodologies put stringent demands on UAT, if only for the frequency at which it needs to be conducted due to the iterative development of small product releases. In this setting, traditional in-person meetings might not scale up well. Complementary ways are needed to reduce the costs of developer-customer collaboration during UAT. This work introduces a wiki-based approach where customers and developers asynchronously collaborate: developers set the UAT scaffolding that will later shepherd customers when testing. To facilitate understanding, mind maps are used to represent UAT sessions. To facilitate engagement, a popular mind map editor, FreeMind, is turned into an editor for FitNesse, the wiki engine in which these ideas are borne out. The approach is evaluated through a case study involving three real customers. First evaluations are promising. Though at different levels of completeness, the three customers were able to complete a UAT. Customers valued asynchronicity, mind map structuredness, and the transparent generation of documentation out of the UAT session.}

These structured phases provide a systematic approach to software development, facilitating clear communication, reducing errors, and improving collaboration among development teams. For the proper and correct use of SDLC processes, it is essential for both software engineers and software decision makers to perform the correct and needed actions while performing each software process, and one method of facilitating that is multicriteria decision making (MCDM). This study aims to provide a systematic review of the use of MCDM within the field of software engineering (SE), encompassing methodologies such as fuzzy MCDM, AHP, TOPSIS, DEMATEL, and other methods, with a deliberate focus on software engineering development processes. To ensure the high quality of this review, a methodical and structured literature search process was performed with strict selection criteria, resulting in the identification of 32 contributions on the applications of MCDM in SE from various databases, including Scopus, ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore digital library (IEEE), and Web of Science (WOS). The selected papers were taxonomized into seven main categories, with some divided into subcategories. This paper presents a systematic and comprehensive analysis of the aforementioned studies, investigating the challenges, motivations, and recommendations found within each, thereby paving the way for potential future research. Bibliometric analysis is also provided to show concise quantitative analysis of related bibliographic information, which draws several key insights into publication trends. Finally, a critical analysis of the current literature and existing research is presented, while also addressing relevant research gaps.}

abstract = {Model-Based Development (MBD) has been gaining traction in the development of embedded software in many industries, especially in safety-critical domains. The models are typically described using domain-specific languages and tools that are readily accessible to the domain experts. Consequently, domain experts, despite not having formal software engineering training, find themselves creating models (designs) from which code is generated, thus effectively contributing to the design and coding activities of software development. This new role for domain experts as software developers can have a direct impact on the system safety if the domain experts do not follow software engineering best practices. In this chapter, we describe our experiences as software engineers in multiyear collaborations with domain experts from the automotive industry, who are developing embedded software with the MBD approach. We provide guidelines that strengthen the collaboration between domain experts and software engineers and improve the quality, and hence safety, of embedded software systems developed using MBD. We clarify the role of some of the most commonly used software engineering principles and artefacts, while also addressing issues and misconceptions encountered in adopting software engineering practices in MBD. Although this chapter focuses on the MBD of automotive embedded software in Matlab Simulink, the guidelines we provide are applicable to the MBD of software in general.}

abstract = {Objective
Given its role in converting testosterone to dihydrotestosterone and cortisol to dihydrocortisol, 5α-reductase may be important in the pathophysiology of the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Increased activity of this enzyme has already been demonstrated in ovaries of affected women, and might be caused by genetic alterations. The aim of this study was to analyze representative genetic variants of both isoforms of 5α-reductase with regard to PCOS parameters in lean and obese women.
Study design
We analyzed one single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs523349) of the isoform 2 (SRD5A2) and one haplotype of the isoform 1 (SRD5A1), consisting of the two SNPs rs39848 and rs3797179, in 249 women with PCOS and 226 healthy women using a 5′-exonuclease-assay. The genotypes were associated with anthropometric, metabolic and hormonal as well as functional tests in these women.
Results
In the investigated haplotype of SRD5A1, the TA variant was associated with an increased frequency of PCOS (P=0.022) and an increased Ferriman–Gallwey Score (hirsutism) (P=0.016) in women with normal weight. The G allele at the examined position of the SRD5A2 showed a decreased frequency of PCOS (P=0.03) in women with normal weight.
Conclusion
One of the keys in the development of the PCOS is hyperandrogenism, which might be caused by an increased 5α-reductase activity, as it is often seen in obesity. This mechanism might therefore be of importance in lean PCOS patients and contribute to the clinical findings.}

These ranges provide a platform for conducting cybersecurity exercises; however, conducting such exercises is a complex process because they involve people with different skill sets for the scenario modeling, infrastructure preparation, dry run, execution, and evaluation. This process is very complex and inefficient in terms of time and resources. Moreover, the exercise infrastructure created in current cyber ranges does not reflect the dynamic environment of real-world systems and does not provide adaptability for changing requirements. To tackle these issues, we developed a system that can automate many tasks of the cybersecurity exercise life cycle. We used model-driven approaches to (1) model the roles of the different teams present in the cybersecurity exercises and (2) generate automation artifacts to execute their functions efficiently in an autonomous manner. By executing different team roles such as attackers and defenders, we can add friction in the environment, making it dynamic and realistic. We conducted case studies in the form of operational cybersecurity exercises involving national-level cybersecurity competitions and a university class setting in Norway to evaluate our developed system for its efficiency, adaptability, autonomy, and skill improvement of the exercise participants. In the right conditions, our proposed system could create a complex cybersecurity exercise infrastructure involving 400 nodes with customized vulnerabilities, emulated attackers, defenders, and traffic generators under 40 minutes. It provided a realistic environment for cybersecurity exercises and positively affected the exercise participants’ skill sets.}

Modeling stakeholders, who have different academic backgrounds (e.g., not only based on ”computing disciplines”), might be lacking knowledge in key modeling topics, which might be learned or improved at the workplace. To better align the modeling skills learnt at the academia with the expectations of the industry, it is important to analyze the relation between the educational skill-set and the modeling practices of the practitioners based on various modeling approaches. Moreover, understanding the-state-of-the-practices for modeling characteristics (e.g., purposes, languages, software development lifecycle phases, where modeling is used) is also necessary to provide a view on various modeling approaches used in the software industry. To achieve these goals, we designed and conducted a practitioner survey. 628 software practitioners, whose undergraduate degree was completed in Turkey, working in 13 countries responded the survey. This paper sheds light on the latest modeling practices with various cross-factor analyses by analyzing the relation of educational background with those modeling practices. Investigating how the way(s) of learning about software modeling affect related practices helps bridge the knowledge gaps. We believe that our findings would provide practical benefits to all modeling professionals (from developers to systems engineers and testers) and educators by influencing both the academia (mostly Turkish universities) and the industry.}

HiL test cases manipulate hardware, are time-consuming and their behaviors are impacted by the uncertainties in the CPS environment. To mitigate the risks associated with HiL testing, engineers have to ensure that (1) test cases are well-behaved, e.g., they do not damage hardware, and (2) test cases can execute within a time budget. Leveraging the UML profile mechanism, we develop a domain-specific language, HITECS, for HiL test case specification. Using HITECS, we provide uncertainty-aware analysis methods to check the well-behavedness of HiL test cases. In addition, we provide a method to estimate the execution times of HiL test cases before the actual HiL testing. We apply HITECS to an industrial case study from the satellite domain. Our results show that: (1) HITECS helps engineers define more effective assertions to check HiL test cases, compared to the assertions defined without any systematic guidance; (2) HITECS verifies in practical time that HiL test cases are well-behaved; (3) HITECS is able to resolve uncertain parameters of HiL test cases by synthesizing conditions under which test cases are guaranteed to be well-behaved; and (4) HITECS accurately estimates HiL test case execution times.}

To define the syntax, semantics and notions of the DSML, the domain model of the STSAS from which we generalize the domain concepts and relationships among these concepts is given, and then, the domain model is mapped into a UML meta-model, named UML-STSAS profile.

Given the diversity of tools and approaches, it is necessary to classify existing TBCG techniques to better guide developers in their choices. Objective: The goal of this article is to better understand the characteristics of TBCG techniques and associated tools, identify research trends, and assess the importance of the role of MDE in this code synthesis approach. Method: We survey the literature to paint an interesting picture about the trends and uses of TBCG in research. To this end, we follow a systematic mapping study process. Results: Our study shows, among other observations, that the research community has been diversely using TBCG over the past 16 years. An important observation is that TBCG has greatly benefited from MDE. It has favored a template style that is output-based and high-level modeling languages as input. TBCG is mainly used to generate source code and has been applied to many domains. Conclusion: TBCG is now a mature technique and much research work is still conducted in this area. However, some issues remain to be addressed, such as support for template definition and assessment of the correctness and quality of the generated code.}

Software implementing weather and climate models is complex to develop and hard to maintain, and requires a large range of different competencies, ranging from environmental sciences, numerical methods, to low level programming. In order to manage this complexity we developed GridTools, a set of software libraries targeted at weather and climate model developers. By separating the model description (front-end) from its efficient implementation on the target platform (back-end), GridTools allows the implementation of performance-portable simulations on a variety of platforms, such as multicore and GPU-accelerated systems. We discuss the application of GridTools to the regional weather and climate model COSMO and show performance results on simple benchmarks as well as on COSMO.}

abstract = {Context
Domain engineering aims at facilitating software development in an efficient and economical way. One way to measure that is through productivity indicators, which refer to the ability of creating a quality software product in a limited period and with limited resources. Many approaches have been devised to increase productivity; however, these approaches seem to suffer from a tension between expressiveness on the one hand, and applicability (or the lack of it) in providing guidance for developers.
Objective
This paper evaluates the applicability and efficiency of adopting a domain engineering approach, called Application-based DOmain Modeling (ADOM), in the context of the programming task with Java, and thus termed ADOM-Java, for improving productivity in terms of code quality and development time.
Method
To achieve that objective we have qualitatively evaluate the approach using questionnaires and following a text analysis procedure. We also set a controlled experiment in which 50 undergraduate students performed a Java-based programming task using either ADOM-Java or Java alone.
Results
The qualitative evaluation reveal that the approach is easy to uses and provides valuable guidance. Nevertheless, it requires training. The outcomes of the experiment indicate that the approach is applicable and that the students that used ADOM-Java achieved better code quality, as well as better functionality and within less time than the students who used only Java.
Conclusion
The results of the experiments imply that by providing a code base equipped with reuse guidelines for programmers can increase programming productivity in terms of quality and development time. These guidelines may also enforce coding standards and architectural design.}

abstract = {In the development of web information systems, design tasks are commonly used in approaches for Model-Driven Web Engineering (MDWE) to represent models. To generate fully implemented prototypes, these models require a rich representation of the semantics for actions (e.g., database persistence operations). In the development of some use case scenarios for the multi-layered development of web information systems, these design tasks may consume weeks of work even for experienced designers. The literature pointed out that the impossibility for executing a software project with short iterations hampers the adoption of some approaches for design in some contexts, such as start-up companies. A possible solution to introduce design tasks in short iterations is the use of automated design techniques, which assist the production of models by means of transformation tasks and refinements. This paper details our methodology for MDWE, which is supported by automated design techniques strictly associated with use case patterns of type CRUD. The novelty relies on iterations that are possible for execution with short time-scales. This is a benefit from automated design techniques not observed in MDWE approaches based on manual design tasks. We also report on previous experiences and address open questions relevant for the theory and practice of MDWE.}

Five years after that first study, the authors felt it is time to replicate the survey and analyze what has changed and what not from 2004 to 2009. This study was conducted during the summer of 2009 by surveying software organizations in the Canadian province of Alberta. The survey results reveal important and interesting findings about software testing practices in Alberta, and point out what has changed from 2004 to 2009 and what not. Note that although our study is conducted in the province of Alberta, we have compared the results to few international similar studies, such as the ones conducted in the US, Turkey, Hong Kong and Australia, The study should thus be of interest to all testing professionals world-wide. Among the findings are the followings: (1) almost all companies perform unit and system testing with a slight increase since 2004, (2) automation of unit, integration and systems tests has increased sharply since 2004, (3) more organization are using observations and expert opinion to conduct usability testing, (4) the choices of test-case generation mechanisms have not changed much from 2004, (5) JUnit and IBM Rational tools are the most widely used test tools, (6) Alberta companies still face approximately the same defect-related economic issues as do companies in other jurisdictions, (7) Alberta software firms have improved their test automation capability since 2004, but there is still some room for improvement, and (8) compared to 2004, more companies are spending more effort on pre-release testing.}

abstract = {Software vulnerabilities can affect critical systems within an organization impacting processes, workflows, privacy, and safety. When a software vulnerability becomes known, affected systems are at risk until appropriate updates become available and eventually deployed. This period can last from a few days to several months, during which attackers can develop exploits and take advantage of the vulnerability. It is tedious and time-consuming to keep track of vulnerabilities manually and perform necessary actions to shut down, update, or modify systems. Vulnerabilities affect system components, such as a web server, but sometimes only target specific versions or component combinations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for automated mode switching of software systems to support system administrators in dealing with vulnerabilities and reducing the risk of exposure. We rely on model-driven techniques and use a multi-modal architecture to react to discovered vulnerabilities and provide automated contingency support. We have developed a dedicated domain-specific language to describe potential mitigation as mode switches. We have evaluated our approach with a web server case study, analyzing historical vulnerability data. Based on the vulnerabilities scores sum, we demonstrated that switching to less vulnerable modes reduced the attack surface in 98.9% of the analyzed time.

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on V&V solutions for BC-Apps. Specifically, using a layered approach, we synthesize V&V tools and techniques addressing different components at various layers of the BC-App stack, as well as across the whole stack. Next, we provide a discussion on the challenges associated with BC-App V&V, and summarize a set of future research directions based on the challenges and gaps identified in existing research work.

abstract = {For software maintenance and evolution, insight into the codebase is crucial. One way to enhance insight is the application of static analysis to extract and visualize program-specific relations from the code itself, such as call graphs and inheritance trees. Yet, software often contains in-house libraries: unique, domain-specific libraries whose usage is typically scattered throughout the codebase. To provide sufficient insight into the usage of those libraries, the static analysis must be customized with domain-specific information. In this paper, we propose a method to enhance insight into the usage of in-house libraries by producing custom overviews. Furthermore, we describe three exploratory case studies targeting industrial C++ and Ada codebases, in which the method was developed, evolved, and validated. The method prescribes how to create custom overviews using static analysis iteratively, starting from a user-provided, initial specification of proper library usage using code patterns. As a safeguard, the method includes cross-checks to detect code fragments that deviate from proper library usage. Whenever such a deviating library usage is found, the code owners determine whether that deviating library usage should be added to the specification of proper library usage or the code fragment should be made compliant. The latter alternative makes both the codebase more regular and keeps the custom static analysis simpler. The method creates custom overviews that reveal opportunities to improve the usage of the in-house libraries, e.g., the removal of domain-specific redundant code which cannot be detected using generic tools, such as compilers and linters. We observed that industrial codebases are regular enough to create custom overviews using static analysis in the three exploratory case studies. Furthermore, we observed that the cross-checks, which detect deviating library usage, ensure the validity and completeness of the custom overviews. We conclude that producing custom overviews for in-house libraries using the method is valuable and feasible.}

In software development, Testing is an important mechanism both to identify defects and assure that completed products work as specified. This is a common practice in single-system development, and continues to hold in Software Product Lines (SPL). Even though extensive research has been done in the SPL Testing field, it is necessary to assess the current state of research and practice, in order to provide practitioners with evidence that enable fostering its further development.
Objective
This paper focuses on Testing in SPL and has the following goals: investigate state-of-the-art testing practices, synthesize available evidence, and identify gaps between required techniques and existing approaches, available in the literature.
Method
A systematic mapping study was conducted with a set of nine research questions, in which 120 studies, dated from 1993 to 2009, were evaluated.
Results
Although several aspects regarding testing have been covered by single-system development approaches, many cannot be directly applied in the SPL context due to specific issues. In addition, particular aspects regarding SPL are not covered by the existing SPL approaches, and when the aspects are covered, the literature just gives brief overviews. This scenario indicates that additional investigation, empirical and practical, should be performed.
Conclusion
The results can help to understand the needs in SPL Testing, by identifying points that still require additional investigation, since important aspects regarding particular points of software product lines have not been addressed yet.}

This strategy relies on a database of previously automated seed test steps, available for reuse. New steps are automated via a capturing process by a tester, without requiring any programming knowledge. Automated tests can be executed by a replay facility. We discuss the reuse improvement, implementation effort, and user feedback regarding the industrial applicability and usability of our capture & replay tool. We then show that restricting the input textual description to obey a proposed Controlled NL (CNL) brings significant advantages: (1) reuse improvement; (2) the possibility of integration with a test generation framework; and (3) definition of consistency notions for test actions and test action sequences, that ensure, respectively, well-formedness of each action and a proper configuration to safely execute a sequence of actions. We formalize these consistency notions in Alloy and use the Alloy Analyzer to carry out the consistency check; the scalability of the analysis is assessed via an evaluation considering a repository with real test cases; the practical context of our work is mobile device testing, involving a partnership with Motorola Mobility, a Lenovo company.}

To ensure the correctness of the generated models, these model transformations need to be extensively tested. However, during the regression testing of these model transformations, it becomes too costly to frequently run a large number of test cases. Test case prioritization techniques are needed to rank the test cases and help the tester during the regression testing to be more efficient. The objective is to rank the fault revealing test cases higher so that a tester can only execute the top ranked test cases and still be able to detect as many faults as possible in the case of limited budget and resources. The aim of this paper is to present a test prioritization approach for the regression testing of model transformations. The approach is based on exploiting the rule coverage information of the test cases. The paper presents an empirical study which compares several techniques introduced by our approach for prioritizing test cases.

It is to date the best way we know how to express low-level logic and manipulate electrical hardware signals. However, the exponential technological growth is continuing to raise the expectations on what automation systems are supposed to be capable of doing. Fulfilling rising requirements and managing the exploding complexity requires a systematic support for high-level descriptions, structuring, and communication, which the original approach was not built to provide. This work proposes the introduction of an abstraction layer, a component-container infrastructure, defined on top of standard system and software models in automation and mirroring the world of cyber–physical systems, where independent components are interconnected to realize the systems’ purpose by using each other’s functionalities. The concept is implemented in the form of a domain-specific modeling language, applying a classical two-level Model-driven Software Engineering (MDSE) approach. By engineering distinct industrial use cases in accordance with the proposed approach, it is shown that the defined abstractions and mechanisms are capable of expressing the nuances of software design in different domains and can enable the streamlining of the automation systems engineering workflow into a virtual plug&produce process.}

Semen samples were analyzed for motility, vitality, morphology, and functional characteristics before glycan profiling. Utilizing group of nine different lectins through cytochemistry and flow cytometry analyses we identified differentially abundant glycans (DAGs) on sperm membrane. HF bulls exhibited superior sperm quality and significantly higher glycan abundance than LF bulls. MAL-II (Maackia amurensis lectin II) depicted stronger binding affinity with HF sperm indicating a higher presence of α-2,3-linked sialic acid residues crucial for sperm function. JAC (Artocarpus integrifolia) binding revealed an abundance of N-acetylgalactosamine, while ABL (Agaricus bisporus lectin) indicated greater mannose-containing glycoconjugates in HF sperm. The glycan map of buffalo spermatozoa underscores a higher abundance of α-2,3-linked sialic acids and acetylgalactosamine in HF sperm, highlighting the potential role of glycan profiling as a screening tool for selecting highly fertile bulls. The findings of this study can pave the way to develop a fertility prediction tool as a rapid lab-on-strip device for enhancing the reproductive and breeding performance of buffalo bulls.}

GSMART enables the automatic generation of a “Service Dependency Graph (SDG)” by which to visualize and analyze dependency relationships between microservices as well as between services and scenarios.

In this chapter, we provide a broad background on web applications and the challenges in testing these distributed, dynamic applications made up of heterogeneous components. We then focus on the recent advances in web application testing that were published between 2010 and 2014, including work on test-case generation, oracles, testing evaluation, and regression testing.

The only way to avoid these mistakes is to introduce redundancy in the software engineering process. This article is a plea to consciously introduce several levels of redundancy for each programming task. Depending on the required level of correctness, expressed in a residual error probability (typically 10−3 to 10−10), each programming task must be carried out redundantly 4 to 8 times. This number is hardly influenced by the size of a programming endeavour. Training software engineers do have some effect as non-trained software engineers require a double amount of redundant tasks to deliver software of a desired quality. More compact programming, for instance by using domain specific languages, only reduces the number of redundant tasks by a small constant.}

BDD is largely facilitated through simple domain specific languages (DSL) and usually restricted to technical test domain concepts. Integrating business domain concepts to implement a ubiquitous language for all members of the development team is an appealing test language improvement issue. But the integration of business domain concepts into BDD toolkits has so far not been investigated. Objective: The objective of the study presented in this paper is to examine whether supporting the ubiquitous language features inside a DSL, by extending a DSL with business domain concepts, is beneficial over using a DSL without those concepts. In the context of the study, benefit is measured in terms of perceived quality, creation time and length of the created test case specifications. In addition, we analyze if participants feel supported when using predefined business domain concepts. Method: We investigate the creation of test case specifications, similar to BDD, in a controlled student experiment performed with graduate students based on a novel platform for DSL experimentation. The experiment was carried out by two groups, each solving a similar comparable test case, one with the simple DSL, the other one with the DSL that includes business domain concepts. A crossover design was chosen for evaluating the perceived quality of the resulting specifications. Results: Our experiment indicates that a business domain aware language allows significant faster creation of documents without lowering the perceived quality. Subjects felt better supported by the DSL with business concepts. Conclusion: Based on our findings we propose that existing BDD toolkits could be further improved by integrating business domain concepts.}

Abstract
Poly- and per-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are synthetic environmentally persistent chemicals. Despite the phaseout of specific PFAS, their inherent stability has resulted in ubiquitous and enduring environmental contamination. PFAS bioaccumulation has been reported globally with omnipresence in most populations wherein they have been associated with a range of negative health effects, including strong associations with increased instances of testicular cancer and reductions in overall semen quality. To elucidate the biological basis of such effects, we employed an acute in vitro exposure model in which the spermatozoa of adult male mice were exposed to a cocktail of PFAS chemicals at environmentally relevant concentrations. We hypothesized that direct PFAS treatment of spermatozoa would induce reactive oxygen species generation and compromise the functional profile and DNA integrity of exposed cells. Despite this, post-exposure functional testing revealed that short-term PFAS exposure (3 h) did not elicit a cytotoxic effect, nor did it overtly influence the functional profile, capacitation rate, or the in vitro fertilization ability of spermatozoa. PFAS treatment of spermatozoa did, however, result in a significant delay in the developmental progression of the day 4 pre-implantation embryos produced in vitro. This developmental delay could not be attributed to a loss of sperm DNA integrity, DNA damage, or elevated levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species. When considered together, the results presented here raise the intriguing prospect that spermatozoa exposed to a short-term PFAS exposure period potentially harbor an alternate stress signal that is delivered to the embryo upon fertilization.
Lay summary
PFAS are synthetic chemicals widely used in non-stick cookware, food packaging, and firefighting foam. Such extensive use has led to concerning levels of environmental contamination and reports of associations with a spectrum of negative health outcomes, including testicular cancer and reduced semen quality. To investigate the effects of PFAS on male reproduction, we incubated mouse sperm in a cocktail of nine PFAS at environmentally relevant concentrations before checking for a range of functional outcomes. This treatment strategy was not toxic to the sperm; it did not kill them or reduce their motility, nor did it affect their fertilization capacity. However, we did observe developmental delays among pre-implantation embryos created using PFAS-treated sperm. Such findings raise the intriguing prospect that PFAS-exposed sperm harbor a form of stress signal that they deliver to the embryo upon fertilization.}

The availability of frameworks such as Cucumber or RSpec makes the application of BDD possible in practice. However, it is unclear to what extent developers use such frameworks, and whether they use them for actually performing BDD, or, instead, for other purposes such as unit testing. Objective:In this paper, we conduct an empirical investigation about the use of BDD tools in open source, and how, when a BDD tool is in place, BDD specifications co-evolve with source code. Method:Our investigation includes three different phases: (i) a large-scale analysis to understand the extent to which BDD frameworks are used in 50,000 popular open-source projects written in five programming languages; (ii) a study on the co-evolution of scenarios, fixtures and production code in a sample of 20 Ruby projects, through the Granger’s causality test, and (iii) a survey with 31 developers to understand how they use BDD frameworks. Results:Results of the study indicate that  ≃  27% of the sampled projects use BDD frameworks, with a prevalence in Ruby projects (68%). In about 37% of the cases, we found a co-evolution between scenarios/fixtures and production code. Specifically, changes to scenarios and fixtures often happen together or after changes to source code. Moreover, survey respondents indicate that, while they understand the intended purpose of BDD frameworks, most of them write tests while/after coding rather than strictly applying BDD. Conclusions:Even if the BDD frameworks usage is widespread among open source projects, in many cases they are used for different purposes such as unit testing activities. This mainly happens because developers felt BDD remains quite effort-prone, and its application goes beyond the simple adoption of a BDD framework.}

abstract = {In many-particle problems involving interacting fermions or bosons, the most natural language for expressing the Hamiltonian, the observables, and the basis states is the language of the second-quantization operators. It thus appears advantageous to write numerical computer codes which allow the user to define the problem and the quantities of interest directly in terms of operator strings, rather than in some low-level programming language. Here I describe a Mathematica package which provides a flexible framework for performing the required translations between several different representations of operator expressions: condensed notation using pure ASCII character strings, traditional notation (“pretty printing”), internal Mathematica representation using nested lists (used for automatic symbolic manipulations), and various higher-level (“macro”) expressions. The package consists of a collection of transformation rules that define the algebra of operators and a comprehensive library of utility functions. While the emphasis is given on the problems from solid-state and atomic physics, the package can be easily adapted to any given problem involving non-commuting operators. It can be used for educational and demonstration purposes, but also for direct calculations of problems of moderate size.

However, applying the approach in industry has resulted in five technical research questions, namely, how to (RQ1) achieve modularity and reuse in a DSL ecosystem, (RQ2) achieve consistency between model and realizations, (RQ3) manage an evolving DSL ecosystem, (RQ4) ensure model quality, and (RQ5) ensure quality of generated code.

This chapter discusses several practical issues and techniques for adopting model-based testing. It starts with the prerequisites of model-based testing and then goes through taxonomy of the possible approaches with the goal of helping one to choose a good approach for one's needs. It deals with people and training issues and discusses how model based testing can fit into agile development processes and the Unified Modeling Language (UML) unified process. One benefit of model-based testing is that it identifies faults in the analysis model and in the requirements earlier in the design process than is usually the case. This can prevent those faults from flowing into the design model and the SUT implementation. This happens because the modeling and model-validation stages of model-based testing raise questions about the requirements and can expose faults well before any tests are executed.}

There are some problems in this process, caused by contradictions and incompletenesses in the specification documents written in natural language, and misunderstanding between specialists in onboard systems, operational engineers, and programmers. In this paper, two practical examples of verification and online updating of spacecraft control logic are described. The approaches we used allow avoiding the mentioned problems.

abstract = {Context
A distributed business process is executed in a distributed computing environment. The service-oriented architecture (SOA) paradigm is a popular option for the integration of software services and execution of distributed business processes. Entailment constraints, such as mutual exclusion and binding constraints, are important means to control process execution. Mutually exclusive tasks result from the division of powerful rights and responsibilities to prevent fraud and abuse. In contrast, binding constraints define that a subject who performed one task must also perform the corresponding bound task(s).
Objective
We aim to provide a model-driven approach for the specification and enforcement of task-based entailment constraints in distributed service-based business processes.
Method
Based on a generic metamodel, we define a domain-specific language (DSL) that maps the different modeling-level artifacts to the implementation-level. The DSL integrates elements from role-based access control (RBAC) with the tasks that are performed in a business process. Process definitions are annotated using the DSL, and our software platform uses automated model transformations to produce executable WS-BPEL specifications which enforce the entailment constraints. We evaluate the impact of constraint enforcement on runtime performance for five selected service-based processes from existing literature.
Results
Our evaluation demonstrates that the approach correctly enforces task-based entailment constraints at runtime. The performance experiments illustrate that the runtime enforcement operates with an overhead that scales well up to the order of several ten thousand logged invocations. Using our DSL annotations, the user-defined process definition remains declarative and clean of security enforcement code.
Conclusion
Our approach decouples the concerns of (non-technical) domain experts from technical details of entailment constraint enforcement. The developed framework integrates seamlessly with WS-BPEL and the Web services technology stack. Our prototype implementation shows the feasibility of the approach, and the evaluation points to future work and further performance optimizations.}

Much research has been carried out to create cloud service registries to help users select cloud services for eventual consumption, especially within the field of semantic web services. Through analyzing real-world requirements of six use cases we identified a gap in research for user-centric technologies. We fill this gap by creating a business vocabulary reflecting common service selection criteria, defining a textual domain specific language to let any user describe services easily, and implementing a novel brokering and matchmaking component to support users in their selection process. As a combination of those technologies, we create the Open Service Compendium (OSC), a crowd-sourced cloud service registry. Our evaluation activities highlight how these developments solve real-world challenges in diverse near-production settings. All of this implies that a substantial benefit for service registry users can be created by following a simple architecture that is focused on their concrete needs — instead of aiming for highest sophistication and broadest applicability as observed in many of the related works.}

Recently, aggregate computing has emerged as a prominent paradigm for so-called collective adaptive systems programming. To shorten the gap between such research endeavours and mainstream software development and engineering, we present ScaFi, a Scala toolkit providing an internal domain-specific language, libraries, a simulation environment, and runtime support for practical aggregate computing systems development.}

This community may be created around the wiki itself (e.g., community of contributors in Wikipedia) or already exist (e.g., company employees in corporate wikis). In the latter case, the wiki is not created in a vacuum but as part of the information ecosystem of the hosting organization. As any other Information System resource, wiki success highly depends on the interplay of technology, work practice and the organization. Thus, wiki contributions should be framed along the concerns already in use in the hosting organization in terms of glossaries, schedules, policies, organigrams and the like. The question is then, how can corporate strategies permeate wiki construction while preserving wiki openness and accessibility? We advocate for the use of “Wiki Scaffoldings”, i.e., a wiki installation that is provided at the onset to mimic these corporate concerns: categories, users, templates, articles initialized with boilerplate text, are all introduced in the wiki before any contribution is made. To retain wikis' friendliness and engage layman participation, we propose scaffoldings to be described as mind maps. Mind maps are next “exported” as wiki installations. We show the feasibility of the approach introducing a Wiki Scaffolding Language (WSL). WSL is realized as a plugin for FreeMind, a popular tool for mind mapping. Finally, we validate the expressiveness of WSL in four case studies. WSL is available for download.}

abstract = {Testing is an essential part of the software development cycle. Unfortunately, testing on constrained devices is currently very challenging. First, the limited memory of constrained devices severely restricts the size of test suites. Second, the limited processing power causes test suites to execute slowly, preventing a fast feedback loop. Third, when the constrained device becomes unresponsive, it is impossible to distinguish between the test failing or taking very long, forcing the developer to work with timeouts. Unfortunately, timeouts can cause tests to be flaky, i.e., have unpredictable outcomes independent of code changes. Given these problems, most IoT developers rely on laborious manual testing. In this paper, we propose the novel testing framework Latch (Large-scale Automated Testing on Constrained Hardware) to overcome the three main challenges of running large test suites on constrained hardware, as well as automate manual testing scenarios through a novel testing methodology based on debugger-like operations—we call this new testing approach managed testing. The core idea of Latch is to enable testing on constrained devices without those devices maintaining the whole test suite in memory. Therefore, programmers script and run tests on a workstation which then step-wise instructs the constrained device to execute each test, thereby overcoming the memory constraints. Our testing framework further allows developers to mark tests as depending on other tests. This way, Latch can skip tests that depend on previously failing tests resulting in a faster feedback loop. Finally, Latch addresses the issue of timeouts and flaky tests by including an analysis mode that provides feedback on timeouts and the flakiness of tests. To illustrate the expressiveness of Latch, we present testing scenarios representing unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing. We evaluate the performance of Latch by testing a virtual machine against the WebAssembly specification, with a large test suite consisting of 10,213 tests running on an ESP32 microcontroller. Our experience shows that the testing framework is expressive, reliable and reasonably fast, making it suitable to run large test suites on constrained devices. Furthermore, the debugger-like operations enable to closely mimic manual testing.}

abstract = {Context
It is an enigma that agile projects can succeed ‘without requirements’ when weak requirements engineering is a known cause for project failures. While agile development projects often manage well without extensive requirements test cases are commonly viewed as requirements and detailed requirements are documented as test cases.
Objective
We have investigated this agile practice of using test cases as requirements to understand how test cases can support the main requirements activities, and how this practice varies.
Method
We performed an iterative case study at three companies and collected data through 14 interviews and two focus groups.
Results
The use of test cases as requirements poses both benefits and challenges when eliciting, validating, verifying, and managing requirements, and when used as a documented agreement. We have identified five variants of the test-cases-as-requirements practice, namely de facto, behaviour-driven, story-test driven, stand-alone strict and stand-alone manual for which the application of the practice varies concerning the time frame of requirements documentation, the requirements format, the extent to which the test cases are a machine executable specification and the use of tools which provide specific support for the practice of using test cases as requirements.
Conclusions
The findings provide empirical insight into how agile development projects manage and communicate requirements. The identified variants of the practice of using test cases as requirements can be used to perform in-depth investigations into agile requirements engineering. Practitioners can use the provided recommendations as a guide in designing and improving their agile requirements practices based on project characteristics such as number of stakeholders and rate of change.}

Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) allow for the building of applications that ease the labour of both software engineers and domain experts thanks to the level of abstraction they provide. In cases where the domain is restricted to Client-Side Web Applications (CSWA), XML-based languages, frameworks and widgets are commonly combined in order to provide fast, robust and flexible solutions. This article presents an approach designed to create XML-based DSL solutions for CSWA that includes an evaluation engine, a programming model and a lightweight development environment. The approach is able to evaluate multiple XML-based DSL programs simultaneously to provide solutions to those Domain Specific Problems for CSWAs. To better demonstrate the capabilities and potential of this novel approach, we will employ a couple of case studies, namely Anisha and FeedPsi.}

In this paper we define a UML profile that allows users to create executable Foundational UML (fUML) stories and scenarios. In order to easily construct scenarios we introduce a BDD model library which contains fUML activities for testing equalities and inclusions. We also present an Eclipse-based development tool that supports a BDD approach for developing fUML components.

abstract = {Rigorous software development involves using highly structured methods and processes in software and system engineering to ensure that the developed products are correct, reliable, and robust. In this context, model-driven development (MDD) has emerged as a development paradigm that emphasizes designing software systems by means of graphical or textual models at different levels of abstraction, which capture different aspects or dimensions of the system-to-be. At the core of MDD is model transformation, which is the process of translating one model into another, according to specific rules. Property preservation in MDD refers to maintaining specific properties of the system model during transformations, including structural, behavioral, and domain-specific constraints. Over the past decades, research on model transformation and property preservation has seen several contributions. In this paper, we present a systematic literature review (SLR) to compile information on study demographics, model properties considered, techniques to ensure property preservation, and other aspects. In addition, through thematic analysis, we highlight significant challenges and benefits associated with model transformation and property preservation. We analyze 202 research studies published between 2000 and 2024. Most of the studies concern case studies (62, 31%) and rigorous analysis (49, 24%), while experimental studies using human subjects are limited (1). Formal logic is the most commonly used transformation language, used in 42 studies (21%), while the Unified Modeling Language (UML) is also used for source (58, 29%) and target (25, 12%) modeling. A total of 100 of the studies (50%) performed system testing on models, while 44 of the studies (22%) used transformation rules to verify transformation properties. Among the verified model properties, 66 studies (33%) focused on consistency management, while 4 (2%) are related to model maintainability and reuse. We conclude from our SLR that property preservation could be improved by using model-specific verification methods and strategies based on the considered model artifacts. Our research also provides a relevant contribution by identifying the major challenges in MDD and proposing relevant solutions.

The web has had a significant impact on all aspects of our society. As our society relies more and more on the web, the dependability of web applications has become increasingly important. To make these applications more dependable, for the past decade researchers have proposed various techniques for testing web-based software applications. Our literature search for related studies retrieved 193 papers in the area of web application testing, which have appeared between 2000 and 2013.
Objective
As this research area matures and the number of related papers increases, it is important to systematically identify, analyze, and classify the publications and provide an overview of the trends and empirical evidence in this specialized field.
Methods
We systematically review the body of knowledge related to functional testing of web application through a systematic literature review (SLR) study. This SLR is a follow-up and complimentary study to a recent systematic mapping (SM) study that we conducted in this area. As part of this study, we pose three sets of research questions, define selection and exclusion criteria, and synthesize the empirical evidence in this area.
Results
Our pool of studies includes a set of 95 papers (from the 193 retrieved papers) published in the area of web application testing between 2000 and 2013. The data extracted during our SLR study is available through a publicly-accessible online repository. Among our results are the followings: (1) the list of test tools in this area and their capabilities, (2) the types of test models and fault models proposed in this domain, (3) the way the empirical studies in this area have been designed and reported, and (4) the state of empirical evidence and industrial relevance.
Conclusion
We discuss the emerging trends in web application testing, and discuss the implications for researchers and practitioners in this area. The results of our SLR can help researchers to obtain an overview of existing web application testing approaches, fault models, tools, metrics and empirical evidence, and subsequently identify areas in the field that require more attention from the research community.}

abstract = {Nowadays, many companies design and develop their software systems as a set of loosely coupled microservices that communicate via their Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). While the loose coupling improves maintainability, scalability, and fault tolerance, it poses new challenges to the API evolution process. Related works identified communication and integration as major API evolution challenges but did not provide the underlying reasons and research directions to mitigate them. In this paper, we aim to identify microservice API evolution strategies and challenges in practice and gain a broader perspective of their relationships. We conducted 17 semi-structured interviews with developers, architects, and managers in 11 companies and analyzed the interviews with open coding used in grounded theory. In total, we identified six strategies and six challenges for REpresentational State Transfer (REST) and event-driven communication via message brokers. The strategies mainly focus on API backward compatibility, versioning, and close collaboration between teams. The challenges include change impact analysis efforts, ineffective communication of changes, and consumer reliance on outdated versions, leading to API design degradation. We defined two important problems in microservice API evolution resulting from the challenges and their coping strategies: tight organizational coupling and consumer lock-in. To mitigate these two problems, we propose automating the change impact analysis and investigating effective communication of changes as open research directions.

Our method is based on formal models in a dedicated intermediate representation, compiled directly from mixed scores (high-level requirements), and either passed, to the model-checker Uppaal (after conversion to Timed Automata) in the offline approach, or executed by a virtual machine in the online approach. Our fully automatic framework has been applied to real mixed scores used in concerts and the results obtained have permitted to identify bugs in the target IMS.}

abstract = {This Systematic Literature Review (SLR) provides a thorough analysis of the most pertinent research with regard to testing Blockchain oriented Software (BoS). Indeed, it is highly required to test and check the correctness of such kind of software systems before their deployment since they are immutable and cannot be modified once deployed. All the selected primary studies, published between 2017 and October 2022, make use of dynamic testing techniques in order to ensure the trustworthiness and the quality of BoS and to check functional and non-functional aspects such as security and performance. First of all, we study 53 research papers from various electronic databases and classify them according to several factors including (i) the accessibility of smart contract code, (ii) the adopted testing techniques and (iii) the supported vulnerabilities. Then, we emphasize works' benefits and drawbacks while providing a summary about the work done on test generation and selection in this field. At the end, we identify research challenges and potential research opportunities with the aim of giving research lines not yet explored.}

As part of this wide and diverse scenario, developers are now facing various challenges, such as heterogeneity, diversity of communication protocols, discovery of things, and coordination of services, among others. A paradigm that can help to tackle these issues is the model engineering since it allows different elements to be reused which can simplify the work of developers. In this paper, we propose SI4IoT (Service Integration for IoT), a methodology based on MDE (Model-Driven Engineering) for the development of IoT systems. This methodology enables automatic code generation, making it easier for developers to design sophisticated new IoT applications. We focus on a DSL (Domain-Specific Language), a graphic editor, and a set of M2T (Model-to-Text) transformations that generate code for software artifacts on Arduino, Node-Red, Ballerina, and NCL-Lua for deployment on hardware nodes, web services, and DTV (Digital TV). Our proposal consists of a model for the integration of services made up of three layers: physical, logical, and application. To validate our proposal, a Smart Home scenario has been considered, with sensors and actuators which, when combined, allow control of lights and heating. In addition, it allows the user to receive information about their home on television based on the REST services that have been created for the IoT nodes.}

abstract = {In this paper we present a model transformation language based on logic programming. The language, called PTL (Prolog based Transformation Language), can be considered as a hybrid language in which ATL (Atlas Transformation Language)-style rules are combined with logic rules for defining transformations. ATL-style rules are used to define mappings from source models to target models while logic rules are used as helpers. The implementation of PTL is based on the encoding of the ATL-style rules by Prolog rules. Thus, PTL makes use of Prolog as a transformation engine. We have provided a declarative semantics to PTL and proved the semantics equivalent to the encoded program. We have studied an encoding of OCL (Object Constraint Language) with Prolog goals in order to map ATL to PTL. Thus a subset of PTL can be considered equivalent to a subset of ATL. The proposed language can be also used for model validation, that is, for checking constraints on models and transformations. We have equipped our language with debugging and tracing capabilities which help developers to detect programming errors in PTL rules. Additionally, we have developed an Eclipse plugin for editing PTL programs, as well as for debugging, tracing and validation. Finally, we have evaluated the language with several transformation examples as well as tested the performance with large models.}

Moreover, maintaining efficient traceability, integration, and communication between two fundamental system life cycle phases (design time and runtime) is another challenge requiring the scalability of MDE. This paper presents an overview of the ECSEL 11http://www.ecsel-ju.eu/web/index.php. project entitled “MegaModelling at runtime – Scalable model-based framework for continuous development and runtime validation of complex systems” (MegaM@Rt2), whose aim is to address the above mentioned challenges facing MDE. Driven by both large and small industrial enterprises, with the support of research partners and technology providers, MegaM@Rt2 aims to deliver a framework of tools and methods for: 1) system engineering/design and continuous development, 2) related runtime analysis and 3) global models and traceability management. Diverse industrial use cases (covering strategic domains such as aeronautics, railway, construction and telecommunications) will integrate and demonstrate the validity of the MegaM@Rt2 solution.

abstract = {Porting a scientific data analysis workflow (DAW) to a cluster infrastructure, a new software stack, or even only a new dataset with some notably different properties is often challenging. Despite the structured definition of the steps (tasks) and their interdependencies during a complex data analysis in the DAW specification, relevant assumptions may remain unspecified and implicit. Such hidden assumptions often lead to crashing tasks without a reasonable error message, poor performance in general, non-terminating executions, or silent wrong results of the DAW, to name only a few possible consequences. Searching for the causes of such errors and drawbacks in a distributed compute cluster managed by a complex infrastructure stack, where DAWs for large datasets typically are executed, can be tedious and time-consuming. We propose validity constraints (VCs) as a new concept for DAW languages to alleviate this situation. A VC is a constraint specifying logical conditions that must be fulfilled at certain times for DAW executions to be valid. When defined together with a DAW, VCs help to improve the portability, adaptability, and reusability of DAWs by making implicit assumptions explicit. Once specified, VCs can be controlled automatically by the DAW infrastructure, and violations can lead to meaningful error messages and graceful behavior (e.g., termination or invocation of repair mechanisms). We provide a broad list of possible VCs, classify them along multiple dimensions, and compare them to similar concepts one can find in related fields. We also provide a proof-of-concept implementation for the workflow system Nextflow.}

abstract = {The JET Real-Time Protection Sequencer (RTPS) co-ordinates responses for magnetic and kinetic actuators to protect the ITER-Like Wall from possible melting events and other undesirable scenarios. It allows programmable stop responses per pulse, based on alarms raised by other systems. The architecture combines a modular run-time application developed using MARTe (Multithreaded Application Real-Time executor) with the top-level JET supervisory and configuration software, Level-1. Operational experience since 2011 drove a requirement to refactor the system in 2017, moving the maximum degree of functionality from compiled code to configuration data, providing more flexibility, maintainability and verifiability of action(s) to be taken during a pulse. This paper discusses the features of the architecture that made this clean separation of rule-based logic and real-time signal processing possible and practical, including how functions and interfaces between MARTe and Level-1 are organised. It also explains management of configuration data to address development, testing, commissioning and operations, each with individual ownership, responsibility and lifecycles. The core technology enabling this is the Level-1 domain specific language, able to manipulate, validate and load into plant configuration parameter sets. The language also enables implementation of advanced user interfaces, providing operators with the tools to focus on essentials tasks for their area of responsibility. It exemplifies this with recent verification and validation of the refactored protection system: unit/low-level integration tests defined by core developers and integration/behavioural tests defined by JET’s Plasma Operations Group, respectively, ensuring robust and consistent behaviour. We show how the wide scope and power of this language has enabled evolution of JET operations efficiently and correctly over decades of operational experience.}

This chapter describes the metrics and measurements pertinent to the wireless LAN (WLAN) Medium Access Control (MAC), as well as the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)/Internet Protocol (IP) stack. A functional test is concerned with verifying that a device or system functions properly. A performance test is much more broad-based and generic, and is aimed at characterizing a device or system according to some well-defined metric. Indeed, a single performance metric may be applicable to a wide variety of devices. WLAN protocol tests, almost without exception, inject packet traffic into the device under test (DUT) as test stimuli, and measure the DUT response in terms of the number or rate of specific types of packets that it generates in turn. As tests are being performed on the MAC layer, the RF characteristics of the packet traffic are rarely of much interest, beyond ensuring that these characteristics do not skew the test results by causing unexpected issues at the physical (PHY) layer. Conformance tests are almost exclusively performed in a highly controlled and isolated environment, as external interference at the wrong moment can invalidate an entire test. It is found that IEEE 802.11 protocol conformance tests are performed on the different aspects of the WLAN-MAC and PHY protocol specifications.}

However, for Executable Domain-Specific Languages (xDSLs), coverage metrics and associated tools are currently manually defined for each xDSL resulting in costly, error-prone, and non-reusable work. To address this problem, we propose a novel language-parametric test coverage framework for xDSLs. We define two coverage metrics adapted to xDSLs: model element and branch coverage. For performing coverage measurements, we propose a generic technique which can be used out-of-the-box by domain experts using any xDSL to define, execute, and test models. In addition, the coverage of model elements and branches can be parameterized for a given xDSL through the definition of coverage rules using a dedicated language. We showcase two test coverage applications for xDSLs: measuring the quality of test suites for executable models and localizing the models’ faults using Spectrum-Based Fault Localization techniques. We evaluate our approach using four different xDSLs. Results show that (i) we can generate meaningful coverage measurements for all investigated models, (ii) the provided coverage rule language enables framework parameterization for all xDSLs, and (iii) the computed coverage measurements are useful in identifying defects of the models.}

Effects are indispensable in code generators, whether to report failures or to insert let-statements and if-guards. Extensive painful experience shows that unrestricted effects interact with generated binders in undesirable ways to produce unexpectedly unbound variables, or worse, unexpectedly bound ones. These subtleties hinder domain experts in using and extending the generator. A pressing problem is thus to express the desired effects while regulating them so that the generated code is correct, or at least correctly scoped, by construction. We present a code-combinator framework that lets us express arbitrary monadic effects, including mutable references and delimited control, that move open code across generated binders. The static types of our generator expressions not only ensure that a well-typed generator produces well-typed and well-scoped code. They also express the lexical scopes of generated binders and prevent mixing up variables with different scopes. For the first time ever we demonstrate statically safe and well-scoped loop interchange and constant factoring from arbitrarily nested loops. Our framework is implemented as a Haskell library that embeds an extensible typed higher-order domain-specific language. It may be regarded as ‘staged Haskell.’ To become practical, the library relies on higher-order abstract syntax and polymorphism over generated type environments, and is written in a mature language.}

Safe and correct operation is not only the absence of collisions but involves complex spatio-temporal requirements on the externally observable, functional driving behaviour in traffic. In this work, we consider Traffic Sequence Charts (TSCs) as a visual formalism for the specification of complex, functional ADF requirements. We define a monitoring problem for TSCs and finite, sampled observations of ADF behaviour and discuss how monitor verdicts contribute to requirements testing. We show that such monitors can effectively be constructed for realistic requirements and that they can contribute to efficient testing by assessing ADF behaviour at runtime.}

Testing such systems is particularly challenging because they comprise numerous heterogeneous components that can be configured and combined in different ways. Despite a plethora of work investigating software testing in general and software product line testing in particular, variability in tests and how it is applied in industry with cyber–physical systems is not well understood. In this paper, we report on a multiple case study with four companies maintaining highly configurable cyber–physical systems focusing on their testing practices, with a particular focus on variability. Based on the results of the multiple case study, we conducted an interactive survey with experienced engineers from eight companies, including the initial four. We reflect on the lessons learned from the multiple case study. We conclude that experience-based selection of configurations for testing is currently predominant. We learned that variability modeling techniques and tools are not utilized and the dependencies between configuration options are only partially modeled at best using custom artifacts such as spreadsheets or configuration files. Another finding is that companies have the need and desire to cover more configuration combinations by automated tests. Our findings raise many questions interesting to the scientific community and motivating future research.}

They lack the constructs to write more configurable generators than just the number of bits for an operation. Based on Scala, Chisel is a hardware construction language that helps to write hardware generators. Hardware generators are not a new idea. Scripting languages, such as Perl and TCL, are often used to generate VHDL or Verilog code from other sources of system description. However, mixing two languages and embedding VHDL or Verilog strings in generator code is not scalable. As Chisel is embedded in Scala, we can write the generators using the same language/environment as we use to describe the digital logic. This paper explores different examples and patterns to describe parameterizable hardware generators. We are confident that practices from software development can improve the productivity of hardware designers to build and test the next billion transistor chips.}

abstract = {In model transformation (MT) testing, test data generation is of key importance. However, test suites are not available out of the box, and existing approaches to generate them require to provide not only the metamodel to which the models must conform, but some other domain-specific artifacts. For instance, an MT developer aiming to perform an incremental implementation of an MT may need to count on a quality test suite from the very beginning, even before all MT requirements are clear, only having the metamodels as input. We propose a black-box approach for the generation of test models where only the input metamodel of the MT is available. We propose an Ant-Colony Optimization algorithm for the search of test models satisfying the objectives of maximizing internal diversity and maximizing external diversity. We provide a tool prototype that implements this approach and generates the models in the well-established XMI interchange format. A comparison study with state-of-the-art frameworks shows that models are generated in reasonable times with low memory consumption. We empirically demonstrate the adequacy of our approach to generate effective test models, obtaining an overall mutation score above 80% from an evaluation with more than 5000 MT mutants.}

abstract = {Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) in heterogeneous computing have been attracting more and more attention. Development of acceleration systems based on FPGAs involves the cooperation of both hardware and software developers. However, although most hardware acceleration systems are motivated by software developers, software developers are difficult to participant in the system building because of the steep learning curve of the hardware concept and design tools. Moreover, due to the complexity of hardware-software integration in traditional ways, end-to-end performance is hard to evaluate before trivial engineering effort. To address these concerns, we propose an open-source Domain-Specific Language (DSL) based framework called VeriScala11https://www.github.com/VeriScala/VeriScala. to support hardware defining in a high-level language, programmatical testing, and rapid acceleration system deploying. By adopting DSL embedded in Scala language, we introduce modern software development concepts into hardware design and provide a familiar environment to software developers. And by building a stack of middle layers from hardware to software, we provide reduced hardware abstraction and communication interface to facilitate both software and hardware development and system deployment. Through the evaluation of some basic components and real-world demos, we show that VeriScala provides a practical approach to rapid prototyping of hardware acceleration systems.}

For system-level black-box functional testing, ground support equipment is built ad hoc, customized for each different mission. Building any of this specific equipment involves considerable engineering effort that can be diluted using techniques that allow reusing configurations of the test setup environment without recodification. These techniques can be merged into a hierarchical checking process based on independent filters to compare the received outputs with the expected ones. The hierarchical checking allows the separate definition of several layers or levels of validation, from the lowest protocol packet levels to the logical abstractions at the highest application level. This paper introduces a solution based on Model-Driven Engineering for Low-Code Ground Support Equipment. It uses the abovementioned mechanisms to reduce the effort to develop and customize ground support systems for different missions. This solution is integrated within an environment called MASSIVA, which allows the automatic configuration and definition of system-level test procedures.

This central role in validating ideas makes them irreplaceable tools for data-driven research in computer science. Various testbeds were created to provide testbeds for the scientific community. To simplify testbed usage, frameworks help to authenticate users, allocate resources, and run experiments. Each testbed typically implements its own framework using a specific API to realize experiments. Such an experiment design impedes the portability of experiments between different testbeds. In this paper, we present a solution where we port the pos experiment controller to the Chameleon and CloudLab testbed. The well-structured pos experiment workflow allows the creation of inherently reproducible experiments. Previously, the experiments using the pos workflow were only possible in dedicated testbeds. By introducing the portability feature, these experiments can run on Chameleon and CloudLab. We demonstrate that experiments can be executed on any of the mentioned platforms without changing the experiment definition. Based on these results, we discuss how the portability feature will be used in the upcoming SLICES-RI testbeds to create reproducible and easily-shareable experiments.}

We consider a scenario in which the meta-model is manually maintained, which is common in various contexts, such as blended modeling, in which several concrete syntaxes co-exist in parallel. Language workbenches such as Xtext support such a scenario, but require the grammar to be manually co-evolved, which is laborious and error-prone. In this paper, we present GrammarTransformer, an approach for transforming generated grammars in the context of meta-model-based language evolution. To reduce the effort for language engineers during rapid prototyping and language evolution, it offers a catalog of configurable grammar transformation rules. Once configured, these rules can be automatically applied and re-applied after future evolution steps, greatly reducing redundant manual effort. In addition, some of the supported transformations can globally change the style of concrete syntax elements, further significantly reducing the effort for manual transformations. The grammar transformation rules were extracted from a comparison of generated and existing, expert-created grammars, based on seven available DSLs. An evaluation based on the seven languages shows GrammarTransformer’s ability to modify Xtext-generated grammars in a way that agrees with manual changes performed by an expert and to support language evolution in an efficient way, with only a minimal need to change existing configurations over time.}

abstract = {Context:
The Data Stream Processing (DSP) approach focuses on real-time data processing by applying specific techniques for capturing and processing relevant data for on-the-fly results, i.e. without necessarily requiring prior storage. Like in any other software, testing plays a vital role in the quality assurance of DSP applications. However, testing such kind of software is not a simple task. In this context, some factors that make challenging testing are message temporality, parallelism, data volume, complex infrastructure, variability, and speed of messages.
Objective:
This work aims to map and synthesize industry knowledge and experience regarding DSP application testing. Specifically, we want to know about challenges, test purposes, test approaches, test data sources, and adopted tools.
Method:
To achieve the objective, we performed a Grey Literature Review (e.g., blog posts, white papers, discussion lists, lecture themes at technical events, professional social networks, software repositories, and other web-published) on testing DSP applications. We searched the grey literature using Google’s regular search engine in addition to specific searches on technical software development content websites. The selected studies were analyzed using qualitative and quantitative techniques.
Results:
Results are based on evidence from 154 selected sources. The challenges for testing DSP applications are the complexity of DSP applications, test infrastructure complexity, timing, and data acquisition issues. The main test objectives identified are functional suitability, performance efficiency, reliability, and maintainability. The main test approaches reported: Performance Testing, Regression Testing, Property-Based Testing, Chaos Testing, and Contract/Schema Testing. The strategies adopted by practitioners to obtain test data: Historical Data, Production Data Mirroring, Semi-Synthetic Data, and Synthetic Data. We also report 50 tools used in various testing activities, which are used for: automating infrastructure, generating test data, test utilities, dealing with timing issues, load generation, simulation, and others. Furthermore, we identified gaps and opportunities for future scientific work.
Conclusion:
This work selected and summarized content produced by practitioners regarding DSP application testing. We identified that knowledge, techniques, and tools intrinsic to the practice were not present in the formal literature, so this study helps reduce the gap between industry and academia on this topic. The document has delivered benefits to industry practitioners and academic researchers.}

Our research focused on the model-driven reengineering process applied to develop the migration tool for the conversion of PL/SQL code to Java.

This process integrates a TDD-like approach to incrementally develop model transformations with three kinds of validations for the generated code. The implementation and validation of the re-engineering approach are explained in detail, as well as the evaluation of some issues related with the application of MDE.}

While developing a model by extension, executing similar simulation experiments to those performed with the original model reveals important behavioral insights into the extended model. An automatic generation and execution of these simulation experiments can provide valuable support in the process of developing models. A prerequisite is an explicit specification of simulation experiments. Therefore, we annotate models with simulation experiments that are specified in a declarative domain specific language SESSL (Simulation Experiment Specification via a Scala Layer). Based on experiment specifications of the original model, we introduce a mechanism to automatically generate and execute simulation experiments for the extended model with necessary adaptations. Furthermore, as we experiment with stochastic models, we exploit statistical model checking and specify the expected model behavioral properties, against which the simulation results are checked. Thereby, when a model is extended, the original experiment specifications are reused, adapted, and applied to the extended model. Accordingly, the generated simulation trajectories are probed to check whether the expected properties hold with a certain probability or not. Thus, more fast and frequent feedback during model development can be provided to the modeler. Based on a model of membrane related dynamics, we show how the developed approach can be used in successively extending models.}

abstract = {Substation equipment is interconnected through conductors to form a large-scale multi-span system. During an earthquake, individual equipment pieces may suffer local damage that is not visible. Due to the structural integrity of a system, the seismic response is extremely insensitive to the local damage. Thus, the local damage is difficult to detect with traditional time-domain or vibration-mode methods. This hinders the rapid post-earthquake recovery of substations, exacerbating the earthquake-induced losses. This study is based on a generalized transfer matrix in the frequency domain to decouple and eliminate the effects of structural integrity. By inputting the measured displacement responses of equipment during an earthquake into the transfer matrix and inversely calculating, a key indicator EG, the relative error between the theoretically calculated and the actual ground motions experienced by each equipment piece can be obtained. The EG is highly sensitive to locally damaged equipment pieces and has a monotonic relationship with the degree of damage, enabling damage localization and quantitative assessment of stiffness degradation. Based on this principle, a rapid identification framework is proposed. Applying the framework to the randomly generated damage scenarios, it is demonstrated to effectively identify various damage modes, including single-component and multi-component damage within the system. The accuracy of damage localization is 100 %, and the quantitative estimation error for the damage degree is almost within ± 5 %. This framework provides a new path for rapidly identifying post-earthquake damage in substation equipment systems.}

However, there are scarce tools and methods supporting their Validation and Verification (V&V), which are essential activities for the proper engineering of meta-models. In order to fill this gap, we propose two complementary meta-model V&V languages. The first one has similar philosophy to the xUnit framework, as it enables the definition of meta-model unit test suites comprising model fragments and assertions on their (in-)correctness. The second one is directed to express and verify expected properties of a meta-model, including domain and design properties, quality criteria and platform-specific requirements. As a proof of concept, we have developed tooling for both languages in the Eclipse platform, and illustrate its use within an example-driven approach for meta-model construction. The expressiveness of our languages is demonstrated by their application to build a library of meta-model quality issues, which has been evaluated over the ATL zoo of meta-models and some OMG specifications. The results show that integrated support for meta-model V&V (as the one we propose here) is urgently needed in meta-modelling environments.}

abstract = {Formal methods use abstraction and rigorously verified refinement to manage the design of complex systems, ensuring that they satisfy important invariant properties. However, formal verification is not sufficient: models must also be tested to ensure that they behave according to the informal requirements and validated by domain experts who may not be expert in formal modelling. This can be satisfied by scenarios that complement the requirements specification. The model can be animated to check whether the scenario is feasible in the model and that the model reaches the states expected in the scenario. However, there are two problems with this approach. 1) The natural language used to describe the scenarios is often verbose, ambiguous and therefore difficult to understand; especially if the modeller is not a domain expert. 2) Provided scenarios are typically at the most concrete level corresponding to the full requirements and cannot be used until all the refinements have been completed in the model. We show by example how a precise and concise domain specific language can be used for writing these abstract scenarios in a style that can be easily understood by the domain expert (for validation purposes) as well as the modeller (for behavioural verification) and can be used as the persistence for automated tool support. We propose two alternative approaches to using scenarios during formal modelling: A method of refining scenarios before the model is refined so that the scenarios guide the modelling, and a method of abstracting scenarios from provided concrete ones so that they can be used to test early refinements of the model. We illustrate the two approaches on the ‘Tokeneer’ secure enclave example and the ERTMS/ETCS Hybrid Level 3 specification for railway controls. We base our approach on the Cucumber framework for scenarios and the Event-B modelling language and tool set. We have developed a new ‘Scenario Checker’ plugin to manage the animation of scenarios.11The example model and scenario scripts supporting this paper are openly available at https://doi.org/10.5258/SOTON/D1026.}

Objective
The aim of the study was to assess the diagnostic potential of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for pathologies of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) through clinical, electrophysiological and morphological evaluation of the median nerve.
Methods
The present work was a multilevel prospective study involving 30 subjects, 15 of whom had carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) and 15 healthy controls. All subjects underwent clinical evaluation through administration of the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ), electroneurography (ENG), 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging with DTI, and calculation of fractional anisotropy (FA) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) at the flexor retinaculum. Tractography was also performed for three-dimensional reconstruction of the route of the median nerve through the carpal tunnel. The degree of functional impairment was compared with the anatomical damage to the median nerve according to ENG and DTI.
Results
FA and ADC were significantly correlated with ENG parameters of CTS and BCTQ data. Mean FA and ADC values in the CTS patients were 0.359±0.06 and 1.866±0.050×10−3mm2/s, respectively, vs 0.59±0.014 and 1.395±0.035×10−3mm2/s, respectively, in the controls. FA was decreased and ADC increased in patients with CTS compared with healthy controls (P<0.05).
Conclusion
DTI parameters were clearly confirmed by both clinical and ENG data and, therefore, may be used for the diagnosis of CTS.}

The tool enables users to efficiently solve problems of varying complexity that would be cumbersome to address manually, thus, aligning with industrial practice where engineers rely on commercial software to streamline analysis and design processes. Demonstrations using the tool show that it can accurately produce composite and grand composite curves and compute heating/cooling utility targets, heat recovery targets and pinch points, for any given process data. It can also determine heat exchanger networks that realise these targets. A key distinguishing feature of the tool is its integration of Heat Pumps, which is particularly relevant given the growing trend toward the electrification of heat in industrial systems. Through several case studies, students applied the tool to optimise process energy systems, demonstrating its potential to enhance learning outcomes while providing valuable insights into energy efficiency and decarbonisation strategies. Applied in an industrial decarbonisation challenge in collaboration with a food manufacturer, the tool generates heat exchanger and heat pump integration solutions resulting in significant energy savings—up to 48 % in heating utilities and 100 % in cooling utilities. Overall, the simulation tool effectively bridges the gap between academic learning and industry practice, offering a unique and impactful approach to sustainability education.}

abstract = {Context
Context-awareness challenges the engineering of contemporary software systems and jeopardizes their testing. The variation of context represents a relevant behavior that deepens the limitations of available software testing practices and technologies. However, such software systems are mainstream. Therefore, researchers in non-academic settings also face challenges when developing and testing contemporary software systems.
Objective
To understand how researchers deal with the variation of context when testing context-aware software systems developed in non-academic settings.
Method
To undertake a secondary study (Rapid Review) to uncover the necessary evidence from primary sources describing the testing of context-aware software systems outside academia.
Results
The current testing initiatives in non-academic settings aim to generate or improve test suites that can deal with the context variation and the sheer volume of test input possibilities. They mostly rely on modeling the systems' dynamic behavior and increasing computing resources to generate test inputs to achieve this. We found no evidence of test results aiming at managing context variation through the testing lifecycle process.
Conclusions
So far, the identified testing initiatives and strategies are not ready for mainstream adoption. They are all domain-specific, and while the ideas and approaches can be reproduced in distinct settings, the technologies are to be re-engineered and tailored to the context-awareness of contemporary software systems in different problem domains. Further and joint investigations in academia and experiences in non-academic settings can evolve the body of knowledge regarding the testing of contemporary software systems in the field.}

This work underscores a novel design approach to fabricate textile-integrated multimodal sensors using a conductive ink coated bi-stretch nylon fabric. Conductive ink has been formulated by dispersing high aspect ratio silver nanowires into water-dispersed PEDOT: PSS solution with polyvinylpyrrolidone that allows sensing of various stimuli, including mechanical strains, temperature, humidity, etc. The fabrication of sensing elements involves the interleaving of screen-printed conductive ink into flexible coats, using water-borne polyurethane, achieved by the facile pad-dry-cure technique on bi-stretch fabric like a sandwich. Remarkable mechanical strain sensing performance in terms of sensitivity, repeatability, and stability has been demonstrated along with flexibility, bendability, and compliant form factor, making them suitable for applications in wearable technology and smart textiles. Moreover, the temperature and humidity sensing exhibit rapid response and wide detection ranges, making the sensor adaptable to diverse environmental conditions. The sensing fabric responds well to different strain and compression conditions. The as-developed fabric can also operate as an IR heating element when biased at certain operating conditions. These attributes make such elements an ideal candidate for various applications, such as human motion tracking, environmental monitoring, and healthcare devices. The sensor's low-cost, solvent-free production and scalability make it a practical choice for mass adoption.}

Furthermore, LLaMA-2 sentiment signals show a strong correlation with cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) and surpass traditional methods in predictive accuracy. The summarization process also enhances traditional models, generating significantly higher BHRs with summarized texts than with full texts.

keywords = {Software product line, Software product line testing, Test coverage, Test coverage criteria},
abstract = {Context
In software product line testing (SPLT), test coverage criterion is an important concept, as it provides a means of measuring the extent to which domain testing has been performed and redundant application testing can be avoided based on the test coverage level achieved in domain testing. However, no previous literature reviews on SPLT have addressed test coverage criterion in SPLT.
Objective
The objectives of this paper are as follows: (1) to clarify the notions of test basis and test coverage criterion for SPLT; (2) to identify the test coverage criteria currently used for SPLT; (3) to investigate how various SPLT aspects, such as the SPLT method, variability implementation mechanism, and variability management approach, affect the choice of test coverage criterion for SPLT; and (4) to analyze the limitations of test coverage criteria currently used for SPLT.
Method
This paper conducts a systematic review of test coverage criteria in SPLT with 78 selected studies.
Results
We have several findings that can guide the future research on SPLT. One important finding is that choice of test coverage criterion in SPLT is independent from variability implementation mechanism, variability management, SPL approach, and binding time but is dependent on the variability representation used in development artifacts. Another that is easily overlooked is that SPL test coverage criteria with the same test coverage criterion names of single system testing neither adequately convey what should be covered by the test methods applying them, nor can they be more generally regarded as extensions or generalizations for SPLT of their corresponding test coverage criteria of single system testing.
Conclusion
This study showed that SPL test coverage criteria should be defined or redefined so that they can clearly deliver the target properties to be satisfied by SPLT.}

Several secondary studies have been published on code smells, discussing their implications on software quality, their impact on maintenance and evolution, and existing tools for their detection. Other secondary studies addressed refactoring, discussing refactoring techniques, opportunities for refactoring, impact on quality, and tools support. In this paper, we present a tertiary systematic literature review of previous surveys, secondary systematic literature reviews, and systematic mappings. We identify the main observations (what we know) and challenges (what we do not know) on code smells and refactoring. We perform this tertiary review using eight scientific databases, based on a set of five research questions, identifying 40 secondary studies between 1992 and 2018. We organize the main observations and challenges about code smell and their refactoring into: smells definitions, most common code-smell detection approaches, code-smell detection tools, most common refactoring, and refactoring tools. We show that code smells and refactoring have a strong relationship with quality attributes, i.e., with understandability, maintainability, testability, complexity, functionality, and reusability. We argue that code smells and refactoring could be considered as the two faces of a same coin. Besides, we identify how refactoring affects quality attributes, more than code smells. We also discuss the implications of this work for practitioners, researchers, and instructors. We identify 13 open issues that could guide future research work. Thus, we want to highlight the gap between code smells and refactoring in the current state of software-engineering research. We wish that this work could help the software-engineering research community in collaborating on future work on code smells and refactoring.}

First, uncertainty-wise testing aims to ensure that the SUT deals with known uncertainty adequately. Second, uncertainty-wise testing should be also capable of learning new (previously unknown) uncertainties such that the SUT's implementation can be improved to guard against newly learned uncertainties during its operation. The necessity to integrate uncertainty in testing is becoming imperative because of the emergence of new types of intelligent and communicating software-based systems such as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). Intrinsically, such systems are exposed to uncertainty because of their interactions with highly indeterminate physical environments. In this chapter, we provide our understanding and experience of uncertainty-wise testing from the aspects of uncertainty-wise model-based testing, uncertainty-wise modeling and evolution of test ready models, and uncertainty-wise multiobjective test optimization, in the context of testing CPSs under uncertainty. Furthermore, we present our vision about this new testing paradigm and its plausible future research directions.}

Until recently, mammalian sex differentiation was thought to be finalized in the embryo. Development of the tubular genital tract, external genitalia, secondary sexual characteristics and sexual behavior are determined largely by the developing gonad. In the last decade, however, it has been shown that continuous sex maintenance is required throughout life. We document proposed ovary to testis transdifferentiation in six captive South African lionesses. These lions were phenotypically female until, as older adults, they began to develop manes, clitoromegaly and increased levels of restlessness and aggression. Similar phenotypic and behavioral changes have been reported very rarely in free-ranging lionesses. Five of the lionesses had been treated repeatedly with deslorelin until they stopped showing estrus. Serum levels of testosterone were similar to those recorded in domestic tom cats in the three lionesses tested. Histological examination revealed an absence of ovarian follicles and small to large scattered islands of interstitial-like cells associated, in larger lesions, with Sertoli-like cells arranged in tubular structures. Oviduct and uterus were present in the four animals in which these were sampled. To date, most studies on this phenomenon have been conducted in laboratory animals. This is the first report of this condition in felids.}

To identify the product features that are directly or indirectly affected by the change, a connection of test, requirement, and variant management is necessary. Therefore, an approach to select test cases based on an occurred change using variant and version knowledge is needed. In this paper, such an approach and its possible application in a toolchain are introduced.

abstract = {Context
Large-scale distributed systems are becoming commonplace with the large popularity of peer-to-peer and cloud computing. The increasing importance of these systems contrasts with the lack of integrated solutions to build trustworthy software. A key concern of any large-scale distributed system is the validation of global properties, which cannot be evaluated on a single node. Thus, it is necessary to gather data from distributed nodes and to aggregate these data into a global view. This turns out to be very challenging because of the system’s dynamism that imposes very frequent changes in local values that affect global properties. This implies that the global view has to be frequently updated to ensure an accurate validation of global properties.
Objective
In this paper, we present a model-based approach to define a dynamic oracle for checking global properties. Our objective is to abstract relevant aspects of such systems into models. These models are updated at runtime, by monitoring the corresponding distributed system.
Method
We conduce real-scale experimental validation to evaluate the ability of our approach to check global properties. In this validation, we apply our approach to test two open-source implementations of distributed hash tables. The experiments are deployed on two clusters of 32 nodes.
Results
The experiments reveal an important defect on one implementation and show clear performance differences between the two implementations. The defect would not be detected without a global view of the system.
Conclusion
Testing global properties on distributed software consists of gathering data from different nodes and building a global view of the system, where properties are validated. This process requires a distributed test architecture and tools for representing and validating global properties. Model-based techniques are an expressive mean for building oracles that validate global properties on distributed systems.}

abstract = {Context:
Autonomous driving systems (ADSs) promise enhanced transportation efficiency but face critical challenges in ensuring reliability across complex driving environments. Effective testing is essential to validate ADS performance and mitigate real-world risks.
Objective:
This study investigates current ADS testing practices for both modular and end-to-end systems, identifies key demands (needs required by practitioners and researchers), and examines gaps between research and real-world demands. We review critical testing techniques and extend to involve Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication and Foundation Models (FMs), including large language models and vision foundation models, in enhancing ADS testing performance. We provide literature reviews and outline future directions for each demand of industry practitioners and academic researchers.
Methods:
A large-scale survey was conducted with 100 participants, including industry practitioners and academic researchers. We first discuss survey questions with professionals, distribute them to industry practitioners and academic researchers, and conduct follow-ups. Quantitative and qualitative analyses uncover key trends and challenges.
Results:
Findings reveal that existing ADS testing techniques struggle to evaluate real-world performance comprehensively, including the diversity of corner cases, the gap between simulation and real-world testing, the lack of comprehensive testing criteria, potential attacks, practical deployment for V2X, and the computational costs for FMs. By analyzing participants’ responses and 105 relevant papers, we summarize the future research directions.
Conclusion:
Our study highlights critical research gaps in ADS testing and underscores the demands of industry practitioners and academic researchers. We provide future directions for ADS: comprehensive testing criteria, cross-model collaboration in V2X, enhancing cross-modality (e.g., text and image) adaptation in FM testing, and scalable ADS validation frameworks. These insights contribute to advancing software engineering practices for ADS development, ensuring safer and more reliable autonomous systems.}

This paper proposes a novel classification framework for control logic generation approaches defining criteria derived from industry best practices. The framework is applied to compare and analyze 13 different control logic generation approaches. Prominent findings include different categories of control logic generation approaches, the challenge of dealing with iterative engineering processes, and the need for more experimental validations in larger case studies.}

However, their full potential remains unrealized due, in part, to the lack of application development environments that help engineers integrate the microkernel’s configuration and hosting of application code with modeling, analysis, and verification tools that address broader aspects of the development lifecycle. This paper presents a model-driven tool chain for the seL4 microkernel based on the open source High Assurance Modeling and Rapid engineering (HAMR) code generation framework for the Architecture and Analysis Definition Language (AADL). We describe how the semantics of AADL communication and threading can be realized in terms of the access primitives and strong spatial and temporal partitioning mechanisms provided by seL4. For AADL users, seL4 provides a high-assurance platform with formally verified enforcement of component boundaries and communication pathways. For seL4 users, AADL provides high-level abstractions for developing seL4 applications, along with an ecosystem of system engineering and analysis tools. We illustrate the framework by applying a model-based development environment for increasing resiliency against cyber attacks to an unmanned aircraft flight control system.}

Current challenges for transformation languages include improving usability (i.e., succinct means to express the transformation intent) and devising powerful analysis methods. In this paper, we show how backwards reasoning helps in both respects. The reasoning is based on a method that, given an OCL expression and a transformation rule, calculates a constraint that is satisfiable before the rule application if and only if the original OCL expression is satisfiable afterwards. With this method we can improve the usability of the rule execution process by automatically deriving suitable application conditions for a rule (or rule sequence) to guarantee that applying that rule does not break any integrity constraint (e.g. meta-model constraints). When combined with model finders, this method facilitates the validation, verification, testing and diagnosis of transformations, and we show several applications for both in-place and exogenous transformations.}

abstract = {In patients undergoing coronary surgery, the uptake of amino acids, which has been shown to correlate with oxygen consumption, is a mechanism of cardiac adaptation to the iatrogenic ischemia-reperfusion injury associated with cardioplegic arrest. Based on these premises, we sought to determine whether oral supplementation with mixed amino acids may protect the rat heart exposed to ischemia-reperfusion and to address whether this hypothesized cardioprotection is achieved, at least in part, through preservation of the energy-producing properties of mitochondria. Sprague–Dawley rats were fed (by enteral route) a liquid diet, with or without mixed essential amino acids (daily dose of 1 g/kg) for 30 days. Hearts from anesthetized rats were perfused by the Langendorff method and randomized to 3 groups. The control group was perfused with buffer for 60 minutes; the ischemia-reperfusion control and the amino acid–treated groups were exposed to 35 minutes of ischemia, followed by 60 or 120 minutes of reperfusion. Amino acid supplements minimized infarct size (22 ± 1.8% vs 33 ± 2.5%; p <0.05) and occurrence of cardiomyocyte apoptosis, as assessed by co-localization of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and caspase-3–positive staining (p <0.01). Long-term treatment with amino acids also reduced the proportion of cardiomyocytes exhibiting immunostaining for cleaved caspase-9 (p <0.01) but was ineffective on processing of caspase-8. Similar results were obtained in the whole heart by caspase activity assays (p <0.01). The lessened activation of caspase-9 detected in amino acid-treated hearts paralleled a strong reduction in mitochondrial release of cytochrome c. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content and rate of ATP production in isolated mitochondria were reduced by >75% in control hearts after 2 hours of reperfusion (p <0.05 vs control hearts); these values returned toward those of the control group in hearts supplemented with amino acids (p <0.01). Finally, the oxygen consumption rate in myocardial skinned bundles was markedly reduced in ischemia-reperfusion control hearts and almost normalized in amino acid-treated hearts (approximately 20% and 93% of the value for normoxic hearts; p <0.01). These results suggest that oral amino acid supplementation attenuates the extent of ischemia-reperfusion injury in the rat heart, through preservation of the mitochondria-generated production of high-energy phosphates.}

Video games development is costly and the corresponding verification process is tiresome. Testing the nondeterministic and concurrent behaviors of video games systems is not only crucial but also challenging, especially when the game state space is huge. Accordingly, typical software testing approaches are neither suitable nor effective to find related bugs. Novel automated approaches to support video game testing are needed. This problem has caught researchers’ attention recently. Approaches found in the literature have tried to address two sub problems: modeling and uncovering bugs. Colored Petri nets is known to support modeling and verifying concurrent and nondeterministic systems. Search approaches have been used in the literature to check the availability of faulty states through exploring state spaces. However, these approaches tend to lack adaptability to test different video games systems due to the limitations of the defined fitness functions, in addition to difficulties in searching huge state spaces due to exhaustive and unguided search. The availability of automated approaches that guide and direct the process of bugs finding is mandatory. Thus, in this study we address this problem as we present a solution for automated software testing using collaborative work of two genetic algorithms (i.e. co-evolutionary) agents, where our approach is applied to colored Petri nets representations of the software workflow. The results of our experiments have shown the potential of the proposed approach in effectively finding bugs automatically.}

To evaluate if a single blood flow restriction (BFR)-exercise bout would induce hypoalgaesia in patients with anterior knee pain (AKP) and allow painless application of therapeutic exercise.
Design
Cross-sectional repeated measures design.
Setting
Institutional out-patients physiotherapy clinic.
Patients
Convenience sample of 30 AKP patients.
Intervention
BFR was applied at 80% of complete vascular occlusion. Four sets of low-load open kinetic chain knee extensions were implemented using a pain monitoring model.
Main outcome measurements
Pain (0–10) was assessed immediately after BFR application and after a physiotherapy session (45 min) during shallow and deep single-leg squat (SSLS, DSLS), and step-down test (SDT). To estimate the patient rating of clinical effectiveness, previously described thresholds for pain change (≥40%) were used, with appropriate adjustments for baseline pain levels.
Results
Significant effects were found with greater pain relief immediate after BFR in SSLS (d = 0.61, p < 0.001), DSLS (d = 0.61, p < 0.001), and SDT (d = 0.60, p < 0.001). Time analysis revealed that pain reduction was sustained after the physiotherapy session for all tests (d(SSLS) = 0.60, d(DSLS) = 0.60, d(SDT) = 0.58, all p < 0.001). The reduction in pain effect size was found to be clinically significant in both post-BFR assessments.
Conclusion
A single BFR-exercise bout immediately reduced AKP with the effect sustained for at least 45 min.}

This paper takes a software-centered interpretation of the ISO 42010 notion of architecture, enhancing it with a component model that attributes separate concerns to distinct design views. The component boundary becomes the border between functional and extra-functional concerns. The latter are treated as decorations placed on the outside of components, satisfied by implementation artifacts separate from and composable with the implementation of the component internals. The approach was evaluated by industrial users from several domains, with remarkably positive results.}

Accumulating evidence suggests that the pathway also critically regulates these events during placental development and differentiation. Herein, we summarize our present knowledge about Notch signalling in murine and human placentation and discuss its potential role in the pathophysiology of gestational disorders. Studies in mice suggest that Notch controls trophectoderm formation, decidualization, placental branching morphogenesis and endovascular trophoblast invasion. In humans, the particular signalling cascade promotes formation of the extravillous trophoblast lineage and regulates trophoblast proliferation, survival and differentiation. Expression patterns as well as functional analyses indicate distinct roles of Notch receptors in different trophoblast subtypes. Altered effects of Notch signalling have been detected in choriocarcinoma cells, consistent with its role in cancer development and progression. Moreover, deregulation of Notch signalling components were observed in pregnancy disorders such as preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction. In summary, Notch plays fundamental roles in different developmental processes of the placenta. Abnormal signalling through this pathway could contribute to the pathogenesis of gestational diseases with aberrant placentation and trophoblast function.}

Mobile apps (software) are used in almost all aspects of daily life by billions of people. Given the widespread use of mobile apps in various domains, the demand for systematic testing of their Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) is crucial. Despite the significant advances in automated mobile app testing over the last decade, certain challenges remain, most notably the app-specific GUI test-oracle problem, which can significantly hinder the effective detection of defects in mobile apps. In this study, we introduce the use of GUI-level invariants, referred to as GUI invariants, as app-specific GUI oracles in GUI test cases to address this challenge.
Methods
We propose a semi-automatic solution to extract GUI invariants and use them as app-specific GUI oracles in test cases. We use the mutation testing technique to evaluate the (fault detection) effectiveness of the GUI oracles used. In addition, we evaluate their quality aspects, namely correctness, understandability, and compatibility, from the perspective of human experts using a questionnaire survey.
Results
The empirical results show that the GUI oracles used are effective and helpful, as they improved the fault-detection effectiveness of the empirical test suites ranging from 18% to 32%. These results also highlight the efficacy of GUI oracles used in identifying various defects, including crashing and non-crashing functional issues, and surpassing the performance of existing tools in fault-detection rates. Additionally, the questionnaire survey outcomes indicate that the GUI oracles used are correct, understandable, and compatible.
Conclusions
Based on the empirical results, we can conclude that using GUI invariants as GUI oracles can be useful and effective in mobile app testing.}

It is a compromise solution between automated conversion and complete redevelopment. The technical architecture can be revised and the code replaced, but the functional architecture – the use cases remains as it was. The challenge of this approach is to preserve the functionality while changing the technical implementation. This approach is taken when conversion is not feasible and redevelopment is too expensive or too great a risk. It entails more than a 1:1 transformation but less than a total rewrite. The same components remain with different contents. In this paper the case for reimplementation is presented and the process described. The tools required to support the process are identified and their use illustrated.

This diversity is difficult to manage for a user and results in erroneously selected test components and compatibility problems in the test configuration. This paper presents a generative programming approach that handles the diversity of test libraries. Compatibility issues are explicitly evaluated by a new interface concept. Furthermore, a novel model analyzer facilitates the efficient application in practice by migrating existing libraries.

To put these ideas into practice, this work introduces MeTAGeM-Trace, the first prototype of an EMF-based toolkit for the MDD of model-to-model transformations which supports trace generation, i.e. it allows developing model transformations that produce not only the corresponding target models, but also a trace model between the elements of the source and target models involved in the transformation.}

abstract = {This paper describes an approach for generating customized benchmark suites from a software architecture description following a Model Driven Architecture (MDA) approach. The benchmark generation and performance data capture tool implementation (MDABench) is based on widely used open source MDA frameworks. The benchmark application is modeled in UML and generated by taking advantage of the existing community-maintained code generation “cartridges” so that current component technology can be exploited. We have also tailored the UML 2.0 Testing Profile so architects can model the performance testing and data collection architecture in a standards compatible way. We then extended the MDA framework to generate a load testing suite and automatic performance measurement infrastructure. This greatly reduces the effort and expertise needed for benchmarking with complex component and Web service technologies while being fully MDA standard compatible. The approach complements current model-based performance prediction and analysis methods by generating the benchmark application from the same application architecture that the performance models are derived from. We illustrate the approach using two case studies based on Enterprise JavaBean component technology and Web services.}

If the number of undiscovered vulnerabilities is small enough, then a reasonable investment strategy would be to focus on finding and removing the remaining undiscovered vulnerabilities. If the number of undiscovered vulnerabilities is and will continue to be large, then a better investment strategy would be to focus on quick patch dissemination and engineering resilient systems. This paper examines a paradigm, namely that the number of undiscovered vulnerabilities is manageably small, through the lens of mathematical concepts from the theory of computing. From this perspective, we find little support for the paradigm of limited undiscovered vulnerabilities. We then briefly support the notion that these theory-based conclusions are relevant to practical computers in use today. We find no reason to believe undiscovered vulnerabilities are not essentially unlimited in practice and we examine the possible economic impacts should this be the case. Based on our analysis, we recommend vulnerability management strategy adopts an approach favoring quick patch dissemination and engineering resilient systems, while continuing good software engineering practices to reduce (but never eliminate) vulnerabilities in information systems.}

abstract = {[Context] Complex and heterogeneous software systems need to be monitored as their full behavior often only emerges at runtime, e.g., when interacting with other systems or the environment. Software monitoring approaches observe and check properties or quality attributes of software systems during operation. Such approaches have been developed in diverse communities for various kinds of systems and purposes. For instance, requirements monitoring aims to check at runtime whether a software system adheres to its requirements, while resource or performance monitoring collects information about the consumption of computing resources by the monitored system. Many venues publish research on software monitoring, often using diverse terminology, and focusing on different monitoring aspects and phases. The lack of a comprehensive overview of existing research often leads to re-inventing the wheel. [Objective] We provide a domain model to structure and systematize the field of software monitoring, starting with requirements and resource monitoring. [Method] We developed an initial domain model based on (i) our extensive experiences with requirements and resource monitoring, (ii) earlier efforts to develop a comparison framework for monitoring approaches, and (iii) an earlier systematic literature review on requirements monitoring frameworks. We then systematically analyzed 47 existing requirements and resource monitoring approaches to iteratively refine the domain model and to develop a reference architecture for software monitoring approaches. [Results] Our domain model covers the key elements of monitoring approaches and allows analyzing their commonalities and differences. Together with the reference architecture, our domain model supports the development of integrated monitoring solutions. We provide details on 47 approaches we analyzed with the model to assess its coverage. We also evaluate the reference architecture by instantiating it for five different monitoring solutions. [Conclusions] We conclude that requirements and resource monitoring have more commonalities than differences, which is promising for the future integration of existing monitoring solutions.}

There is also difference in the use of use case narratives across various methods due to the lack of guidance on narrative format in the UML specification. The UML specification only states that “use cases are typically specified in various idiosyncratic formats such as natural language, tables, trees, etc. Therefore, it is not easy to capture its structure accurately or generally by a formal model.” This chapter discusses the current state of the art of UML-based software development approaches. Most attention is paid on the artifacts created by using the UML.}

The most effective approaches for achieving this goal at the present time use meta-heuristic optimization algorithms to search for new test cases using fitness functions defined on existing sets of test cases and the system under test. Regardless of how their search algorithms are controlled, however, all existing approaches focus on the analysis of exactly one implementation, the software under test, to drive their search processes, which is a limitation on the information they have available. In this paper we investigate whether the practical effectiveness of white box unit test generation tools can be increased by giving them access to multiple, diverse implementations of the functionality under test harvested from widely available Open Source software repositories. After presenting a basic implementation of such an approach, DivGen (Diversity-driven Generation), on top of the leading test generation tool for Java (EvoSuite), we assess the performance of DivGen compared to EvoSuite when applied in its traditional, mono-implementation oriented mode (MonoGen). The results show that while DivGen outperforms MonoGen in 33% of the sampled classes for mutation coverage (+16% higher on average), MonoGen outperforms DivGen in 12.4% of the classes for branch coverage (+10% higher average).}

Disruption of any of these processes results in congenital anomalies in the affected tissue(s) leading to anterior segment disorders (ASD) including aniridia, Axenfeld-Rieger anomaly, congenital corneal opacities (Peters anomaly, cornea plana, congenital primary aphakia), and primary congenital glaucoma. Current understanding of the genetic factors involved in ASD remains incomplete, with approximately 50% overall receiving a genetic diagnosis. While some genes are strongly associated with a specific clinical diagnosis, the majority of known factors are linked with highly variable phenotypic presentations, with pathogenic variants in FOXC1, CYP1B1, and PITX2 associated with the broadest spectrum of ASD conditions. This review discusses typical clinical presentations including associated systemic features of various forms of ASD; the latest functional data and genotype-phenotype correlations related to 25 ASD factors including newly identified genes; promising novel candidates; and current and emerging treatments for these complex conditions. Recent developments of interest in the genetics of ASD include identification of phenotypic expansions for several factors, discovery of multiple modes of inheritance for some genes, and novel mechanisms including a growing number of non-coding variants and alleles affecting specific domains/residues and requiring further studies.}

abstract = {Coverage-guided greybox fuzzing (CGF) has emerged as a powerful technique for software vulnerability detection, yet traditional techniques often struggle with the increasing complexity of modern software systems and the vastness of input spaces. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have begun to fundamentally transform CGF by addressing these limitations through automated feature extraction, adaptive input generation, and intelligent path prioritization. However, despite these advancements, critical gaps persist in understanding the state-of-the-art landscape. Existing studies often lack rigorous benchmarks to evaluate scalability and generalizability, fail to address the interpretability of neural-guided decisions, and overlook the integration of emerging paradigms such as large language models (LLMs) and neurosymbolic reasoning. This survey systematically bridges these gaps by providing a comprehensive taxonomy of DNN-driven CGF techniques, analyzing their strengths and limitations across key fuzzing stages—seed generation, selection, and mutation. We find that although DNNs have significantly improved fuzzing efficiency, challenges such as semantically invalid seeds, high computational overhead, and limited cross-domain adaptability remain unresolved. Most importantly, we identify two transformative directions with the potential to redefine CGF: (1) LLM-powered fuzzing, which combines generative AI with domain-specific fine-tuning to produce context-aware inputs; and (2) neurosymbolic integration, which merges the precision of symbolic execution with the scalability of neural networks to tackle path explosion. By synthesizing these insights, this survey not only clarifies the state-of-the-art but also outlines a roadmap for developing robust, explainable, and widely applicable intelligent fuzzers. The future of CGF lies in hybrid models that integrate data-driven learning with formal methods, paving the way for autonomous vulnerability discovery in an era of increasingly complex software systems.}

abstract = {The present study in seasonally breeding spotted snakehead Channa punctatus, for the first time in nonmammalian vertebrates, demonstrated correlation between reproductive phase-dependent testicular expression of ligand Jag1/receptor Notch1 and spermatogenic events. Testicular transcriptome sequencing data from our earlier study in C. punctatus was used in the present study to select the best transcript for jag1 (cpjag1) and notch1 (cpnotch1). The transcripts cpjag1 and cpnotch1 encoded full-length putative proteins of 1215 (cpJag1) and 2475 (cpNotch1) amino acids, respectively. A marked homology in the extracellular domains of Jag1 and Notch1 was observed following their alignment with respective proteins from different vertebrates, suggesting conservation in ligand-receptor interaction in C. punctatus. Both cpJag1 and cpNotch1 showed phylogenetic closeness with their teleostean counterparts, especially with that of Perciformes. Temporal expression of cpjag1 and cpnotch1 in testis depending on reproductive phases showed an appreciably high expression during spermatogenically inactive resting and postspawning phases when seminiferous lobules consisted of spermatogonial stem cells and undifferentiated spermatogonia. Their expression sharply declined during spermatogenically active preparatory and spawning phases. It appears that involvement of cpjag1/cpnotch1 is restricted to inactive phases when spermatogonial stem cells renew themselves and replenish undifferentiated spermatogonia. This assumption is ascertained by an experimental study in which high level of testicular cpjag1/cpnotch1 expression in control fish of resting phase markedly decreased after administration of human chorionic gonadotropin that is known to induce proliferation and differentiation of spermatogonia and spawning of spermatozoa.}

Therefore, transferring the role of a traditional centralized service provider to decentralized peers (end-users) acting as service providers is very promising. However, the future of decentralized M2M application services which are independently provided or consumed by several end-users in the M2M community depends on trust. Untrustworthy peers trying to deploy malfunctioning services for others mitigate the benefits of decentralized systems. Nowadays, the concept of distributed ledger and blockchain has an increased popularity regarding trustless computing among communities operating without centralized authorities. This research publication provides a comprehensive analysis and approach merging the concepts of M2M application services, trust and distributed ledger technologies. Moreover, this publication presents an optimized Trust Evaluation System which is used to ensure trustworthiness among peers in a M2M community. To improve the Trust Evaluation System the integration of blockchain for data storage is introduced. Additionally, blockchain technology is used to extend the existing trust model of the Trust Evaluation System to enable tamper-proof data and detection of untrustworthy peers. This publication reviews several existing approaches in the academic and industry sector to highlight the limitations of the blockchain regarding the consensus and proposes a novel Trust Consensus Protocol. This research publication also provides a practical evaluation of the proposed protocol.}

abstract = {Context
Gamification has been proven to increase engagement and motivation in multiple and different non-game contexts such as healthcare, education, workplace, and marketing, among others. However, many of these applications fail to achieve the desired benefits of gamification, mainly because of a poor design.
Objective
This paper explores the conceptualization, implementation and monitoring phases of meaningful gamification strategies and proposes a solution for strategy experts that hides the implementation details and helps them focus only on what is crucial for the success of the strategy. The solution makes use of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) and Complex Event Processing (CEP) technology.
Method
An easy-to-use graphical editor is used to provide the high-level models that represent the design of the gamification strategy and its deployment and monitoring. These models contain the event pattern definitions to be automatically transformed into code. This code is then deployed both in a CEP engine to detect the conditions expressed in such patterns and in an enterprise service bus to execute the corresponding pattern actions.
Results
The paper reports on the use of both a graphical modeling editor for gamification domain definition and a graphical modeling editor for gamification strategy design, monitoring and code generation in event-based systems. It also shows how the proposal can be used to design and automate the implementation and monitoring of a gamification strategy in an educational domain supported by a well-known Learning Management System (LMS) such as Moodle.
Conclusion
It can be concluded that this unprecedented model-driven approach leveraging gamification and CEP technology provides strategy experts with the ability to graphically define gamification strategies, which can be directly transformed into code executable by event-based systems. Therefore, this is a novel solution for bringing CEP closer to any strategy expert, positively influencing the gamification strategy design, implementation and real-time monitoring processes.}

abstract = {Software developers are acutely aware that software build is an essential but resource-intensive step in any software development process, all the more when building large and/or highly configurable systems, whose vast number of configuration options leads to an explosion in the number of variants to build and evaluate. A potential approach to speed up the builds of multiple configurations is to do incremental build, i.e., to not clean the build environment and reuse previous builds when building a new configuration. Previous exploratory studies showed some benefits and limitations of incremental build, but mainly on small configurable software systems and on a limited set of close configurations. However, for large configuration spaces, little is known whether the large distance across configurations impacts the correctness and efficiency of incremental build. This paper presents PyroBuildS, a new approach to speed up incremental builds while keeping reproducibility, featuring a configuration variation operator parameterized by two deny lists of problematic options and a mutation size (diversity). We evaluate PyroBuildS through an empirical study on three large complex configurable systems, namely Linux, BusyBox, and ToyBox, with respectively 18637, 1078, 330 configuration options. We first show that for all configurations PyroBuildS produces the exact same binaries as a clean build, except for Linux with some non-reproducible random configurations. We identify the reasons why incremental build speeds up or slows down the build of large configuration spaces – a knowledge that can be integrated into PyroBuildS. Incremental build systematically pays off, since problematic options are avoided in the first place – something only PyroBuildS does. We also show that a naive use of incremental build on random Linux configurations backfires, taking more time than clean builds. Thus, PyroBuildS controls diversity to avoid too many differences across configurations to perform efficient incremental builds. Thanks to its ability to operate over non-problematic options and close enough configurations, PyroBuildS significantly speeds up the exploration of large configuration spaces, with a gain in build time from 16% to 22% in all three systems with mutated configurations. Finally, with random configurations, PyroBuildS also speeds up the build time from 15% to 20% for ToyBox and BusyBox.}

Here, we adapt a “one-test-at-a-time” greedy method to take importance of pairs into account. The method can be used to generate a set of tests in order, so that when run to completion all pair-wise interactions are tested, but when terminated after any intermediate number of tests, those deemed most important are tested. In addition, practical concerns of seeding and avoids are addressed. Computational results are reported.}

To study the problems faced during quality assurance and certification activities, a case study was performed on legacy software used for thermal analysis of a fuelpin in a nuclear reactor. Although no errors were uncovered in the code, 27 issues of incompleteness and inconsistency were found with the documentation. This work proposes that software documentation follow a rational process, which includes a software requirements specification following a template that is reusable, maintainable, and understandable. To develop the design and implementation, this paper suggests literate programming as an alternative to traditional structured programming. Literate programming allows for documenting of numerical algorithms and code together in what is termed the literate programmer's manual. This manual is developed with explicit traceability to the software requirements specification. The traceability between the theory, numerical algorithms, and implementation facilitates achieving completeness and consistency, as well as simplifies the process of verification and the associated certification.}

Detecting such semantic conflicts requires understanding the behavior of the software, which is beyond the capabilities of most existing merge tools. Although semantic merge tools have been proposed, they are usually based on heavyweight static analyses, or need explicit specifications of program behavior. In this work, we take a different route and propose SAM (SemAntic Merge), a semantic merge tool based on the automated generation of unit tests that are used as partial specifications of the changes to be merged, and that drive the detection of unwanted behavior changes (conflicts) when merging software. To evaluate SAM’s feasibility for detecting conflicts, we perform an empirical study relying on a dataset of more than 80 pairs of changes integrated to common class elements (constructors, methods, and fields) from 51 merge scenarios. We also assess how the four unit test generation tools used by SAM individually contribute to conflict identification. Our results show that SAM performs best when combining only the tests generated by Differential EvoSuite and EvoSuite, and using our proposed testability transformations (nine detected conflicts out of 29). These results reinforce previous findings about the potential of using test-case generation to detect conflicts as a method that is versatile and requires only limited deployment effort in practice.}

Such the systems are expected to have the attributes of reliability, availability, safety, confidentiality, survivability, integrity, and maintainability. Current software and hardware systems continue to evolve in complexity at rapid rates. Although the increase in the complexity of single artifact (such as number of logical decision points in a software package) can often be tracked with Moore's Law like approximations, systems constructed out of larger number of smaller subsystems defy such classifications. The reason for this added complexity is that interactions between the subsystems explode exponentially in the size of the parent system. Yet all component interactions must be addressed exhaustively to predict accurate behavior of the whole system. The challenge that we face is that it is seldom possible to model or test all such interactions in a given system. As a result, building dependable complex systems with realistic assessment of risks of failure is an extremely difficult endeavor. Attempts have been made to ameliorate the difficulty in the engineering of dependable complex systems using lessons from engineering methodologies in other domains. We discuss key attributes of dependable complex systems, with a special emphasis on security where information is involved. We review classical approaches to designing, building, and maintaining dependable complex systems. We present promising features and novel ideas applicable to the lifecycle of dependable complex systems. Most of our discussion is focused within the domain of hardware and software systems. Over time, practitioners in dependable engineering have learned lessons from previous experience and continue to present prescriptive approaches discovered through research and analysis. These lessons and approaches are often applicable to other engineering domains such as construction, transportation, and industrial control. We look at specific engineering challenges and proposed solutions pertaining to the following general domains, with occasional examples from any branch of engineering:•dependable hardware/software systems;•secure dependable systems;•dependable cloud infrastructure and applications. Finally, we conclude with the observation that several approaches are applicable across all these domains and identify accessible techniques that have good potential to increase the dependability of systems. These approaches can be considered as axiomatic in building any future complex systems with a high degree of dependability.}

abstract = {Context
In model-based software development, bidirectional model transformation (BX) provides a fundamental solution to model synchronization that can retain the consistency among models. Similar to conventional programs, a BX program may also contain bugs. Accordingly, a BX program must be tested prior to being used in practice. A challenging problem of testing BX programs is to construct test oracles (e.g., assertions and expected output models), which are usually difficult and/or expensive to manually specify.
Objective
In we paper, we investigate how to alleviate the oracle problem in BX testing via reducing the costs of developing test oracles.
Method
We propose a metamorphic testing approach for BX. First, we identify three generic metamorphic relations for BX. Afterwards, we define a metamodel MT4MT to establish metamorphic test groups and test scripts. We also propose a testing framework to support metamorphic testing based on MT4MT.
Results
We conducted an experimental study of mutation analysis and a case study on three ATL-based ad-hoc BXs. The results of the experimental study and the case study showed that our approach killed 79.38% mutants and enabled us to test real-world ATL-based ad-hoc BXs. We also demonstrated that MT4MT can be used to test the semantics properties of BXs.
Conclusion
Our approach is an effective and practical approach with lower costs of developing test oracles.}

abstract = {Background
Ambient air pollution is a pervasive and ubiquitous hazard, which has been linked to premature morbidity and a growing number of morbidity endpoints. Air pollution may be linked to neurodegeneration, and via this or other pathways, to neurodegenerative diseases. Emerging evidence suggests that air pollution may contribute to neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia, Parkinson’s Disease (PD), Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Motor Neuron Diseases (MND), although this evidence remains inconsistent and very limited for MS and MND. In addition, this evidence base is rapidly emerging and would benefit from a wide and critical synthesis, including a better understanding of heterogeneity.
Objectives
In this paper, we present a protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis and specify our methods a priori. The main aim of the planned systematic review is to answer the question of whether long-term exposure (>1 year) to ambient (outdoor) air pollution (exposure, compared to lower exposure) increases the risk of adult (population) incidence of neurodegenerative diseases (outcomes) in epidemiological observational studies (study design). Another aim is to meta-analyze the associations between long-term exposure to ambient air pollutants and the risk of the selected outcomes and assess the shape of exposure–response functions. To set the stage for the proposed work, we also overview the existing epidemiological evidence in this protocol, but do not critically evaluate it, as these results will be fully presented in the planned systematic review.
Search and study eligibility
We will search the electronic databases Medline (via Ovid), Embase (via Ovid), Cochrane Library, Cinahl (via Ebscohost), Global Health (via Ebscohost), PsycINFO (via Ebscohost), Scopus, Web of Science (Core Collection), from inception to October 2022. Eligible studies must contain primary research investigating the link between 1-year + exposure to any outdoor air pollutant, from any source, and dementia, PD, MS, and MND, or dementia subtypes: Alzheimer’s Disease, vascular dementia, and mixed dementia. The search strategy and eligibility criteria are pre-determined and described in full in this protocol.
Study appraisal and synthesis methods
Articles will be stored and screened using Rayyan QCRI. Title and abstract screening, full text review, data extraction, risk of bias assessment and data preparation for statistical analysis will be conducted independently by two reviewers using pre-defined forms and criteria, described in this protocol. All these steps will also be piloted and the forms and/or methods adapted if issues arise. Meta-analysis and assessment of the shape of the exposure–response functions will be conducted if four independent exposure-outcomes pairs are available, and the remainder of results will be synthesized in the forms of tables and via a narrative summary. Certainty in the body of evidence will be assessed using the OHAT approach. This protocol describes the planned analysis and synthesis a priori and serves to increase transparency and impact of this systematic review and meta-analysis.}

abstract = {Middleware is an integral part of critical software, providing core services for data exchange and manipulation, job execution, and scheduling. Their correctness is central to the correct execution of the software. They must be carefully configured to meet all functional and non-functional requirements. From a set of valid configuration parameters, one then has to demonstrate the implementation is correct and can fulfill its mission. Model-based techniques provide the foundations for correct-by-construction engineering. Most notably, they can be used to model a system, assess its configuration is correct, and then generate the corresponding middleware instance. The SAE AADL language supports the modeling of safety-critical systems and covers its design, configuration, and analysis. In this paper, we present several contributions: the definition of a model of computation aligned with the Ada Ravenscar profile supported by an architectural model expressed using AADL; derivation rules from AADL constructs to middleware services using Ada 2012 and SPARK 2014, and the proof of correctness of the implementation. Our contribution illustrates how one can prove the absence of runtime errors in middleware configured from high-level descriptions. This effort illustrates the positive effect models, programming languages and associated toolsets have on developing high-assurance middleware.}

abstract = {Context
The paper addresses the use of a Software Product Line approach in the context of developing software for a high-integrity, regulated domain such as civil aerospace. The success of a Software Product Line approach must be judged on whether useful products can be developed more effectively (lower cost, reduced schedule) than with traditional single-system approaches. When developing products for regulated domains, the usefulness of the product is critically dependent on the ability of the development process to provide approval evidence for scrutiny by the regulating authority.
Objective
The objective of the work described is to propose a framework for arguing that a product instantiated using a Software Product Line approach can be approved and used within a regulated domain, such that the development cost of that product would be less than if it had been developed in isolation.
Method
The paper identifies and surveys the issues relating the adoption of Software Product Lines as currently understood (including related technologies such as feature modelling, component-based development and model transformation) when applied to high-integrity software development. We develop an argument framework using Goal Structuring Notation to structure the claims made and the evidence required to support the approval of an instantiated product in such domains. Any unsubstantiated claims or missing/sub-standard evidence is identified, and we propose potential approaches or pose research questions to help address this.
Results
The paper provides an argument framework supporting the use of a Software Product Line approach within a high-integrity regulated domain. It shows how lifecycle evidence can be collected, managed and used to credibly support a regulatory approval process, and provides a detailed example showing how claims regarding model transformation may be supported. Any attempt to use a Software Product Line approach in a regulated domain will need to provide evidence to support their approach in accordance with the argument outlined in the paper.
Conclusion
Product Line practices may complicate the generation of convincing evidence for approval of instantiated products, but it is possible to define a credible Trusted Product Line approach.}

Model-based safety analysis techniques use formal methods to rigorously assess the risks associated with safety-critical systems. The adequacy of the results obtained from those formal techniques, however, is greatly influenced by the quality and comprehensibility of the underlying formal models. We introduce our S# modeling framework (pronounced "safety sharp"), an executable, systematic, high-level specification language and tool suite specifically designed for the convenient modeling and formal analysis of safety-critical systems. This paper shows how S# facilitates and improves model simulation, debugging, and testing during all stages of the development of such systems.}

abstract = {The natural substrates of the enzymes involved in type-II fatty acid biosynthesis (FAS-II) are acylated acyl carrier proteins (acyl-ACPs). The state of the art method to produce acyl-ACPs involves the transfer of a phosphopantetheine moiety from CoA to apo-ACP by E. coli holo-ACP synthase (EcACPS), yielding holo-ACP which subsequently becomes thioesterified with free fatty acids by the E. coli acyl-ACP synthase (EcAAS). Alternatively, acyl-ACPs can be synthesized by direct transfer of acylated phosphopantetheine moieties from acyl-CoA to apo-ACP by means of EcACPS. The need for native substrates to characterize the FAS-II enzymes of P. falciparum prompted us to investigate the potential and limit of the two methods to efficiently acylate P. falciparum ACP (PfACP) with respect to chain length and β-modification and in preparative amounts. The EcAAS activity is found to be independent from the oxidation state at the β-position and accepts fatty acids as substrates with chain lengths starting from C8 to C20, whereas EcACPS accepts very efficiently acyl-CoAs with chain lengths up to C16, and with decreasing activity also longer chains (C18 to C20). Methods were developed to synthesize and purify preparative amounts of high quality natural substrates that are fully functional for the enzymes of the P. falciparum FAS-II system.}

keywords = {Microservices, Monolith, Migration, Architecture, Systematic Mapping Study},
abstract = {Context:
The popularity of microservices architecture has grown due to its ability to address monolithic architecture issues, such as limited scalability, hard maintenance, and technological dependence. Nonetheless, the migration of monolith systems to microservices is complex. Therefore, methodologies and techniques are needed to facilitate migration and support practitioners and software architects.
Objective:
The objective of this study is to investigate cases of application migration, microservices identification techniques, tools used during migration, factors that promote migration, as well as issues and benefits of the migration.
Method:
We have conducted this SMS following the guidelines established by Kitchenham and Petersen. The research objective was defined using part of the Goal-Question-Metric model and the Population, Intervention, and Outcome criteria. From 1546 studies that were retrieved from the search execution, 114 were selected and analyzed to answer the research questions.
Results:
This SMS contributes with (i) a migration process proposal based on migration cases, (ii) a characterization of migration techniques based on different criteria, (iii) an analysis of tools to support migration, (iv) the identification of migration drivers, and (v) an exploration of migration issues as well as benefits.
Conclusion:
This SMS sheds light on the complexity and variability of migrating monolithic systems to microservices, as well as the limited number of migration tools. While scalability and maintenance drive migration, few studies assess them. Key challenges include microservices communication and database migration, with most research focusing primarily on monolith decomposition. Despite these difficulties, migration offers benefits, particularly in scalability and maintainability.}

The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical effect of local corticosteroid injection and physical therapy for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome. A systematic literature search of PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane library was conducted to identify relevant randomized clinical trials published before 21st Mar 2023. Two independent reviewers assayed quality of included studies using the Cochrane collaboration risk of bias tool. Relevant data were extracted and pooled analyses were conducted. Outcome measurements included Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire, visual analogue scale and some electrophysiology tests, while the former two were set as the primary outcomes. Subgroup analysis and sensitive analysis were performed and publication bias was evaluated. Heterogeneity among the included studies was examined using the I2 statistic. After selection, 12 studies were identified eligibility for inclusion. Only one study was found to have a high risk of bias. Pooled data of primary outcomes did not show any differences between treatments, and subgroup analysis supported the results. However, patients treated with local corticosteroid injection showed better improvement in distal motor latency (p = 0.002) and compound muscle action potential (p = 0.04). Some studies failed to pass the sensitive analysis, indicating the related analysis might be not so stable. A slight publication bias was observed in subgroup analysis of function scales, among three publication bias test. In conclusion, compared to physical therapy, local corticosteroid injection might have better treatment effects on carpal tunnel syndrome.}

Although more advanced variations may incorporate an advanced search algorithm to cover difficult scenarios, many decisions still have to be made randomly simply because no information is available to calculate the best decision. Because of this, many of the generated sequences may be redundant, while some others may be rare and hard to get. This paper presents a rich formalism that is based on a mix of algebraic relations and Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) to query test suites, and an efficient algorithm to execute such queries. Queries can be used as correctness specifications (oracles) to validate a test suite. They are however more general as they can be used to filter out test sequences with interesting properties, e.g. to archive them for future use. The proposed formalism is quite expressive: it can express algebraic equations with logical variables, Hoare triples, class invariants, as well as their temporal modalities. An evaluation of the query algorithm’s performance is included in this paper. The whole query framework has been implemented in a testing tool for Java called T3i.}

abstract = {Context:
While test automation offers numerous benefits, it also introduces significant challenges. Two challenges that developers and testers face on a daily basis, particularly when using Selenium WebDriver to test web applications, are driver management (involving tasks such as version identification, download, installation, and maintenance) and management of test lifecycle phases (using specific test libraries, as for example JUnit, and inserting annotations into the code). These manual tasks make test suite development particularly tedious, error-prone, and expensive. Recently, to ease the burden on developers and testers, some Java libraries have been proposed, called WebDriverManager and Selenium-Jupiter, capable of automatically carrying out the driver management process for Selenium WebDriver and simplifying the development of test suites. These libraries appear to be very promising but until now no one has experimentally evaluated their effectiveness.
Objective:
To investigate the effectiveness of WebDriverManager and Selenium-Jupiter in reducing driver management times and boilerplate code.
Method:
We designed and conducted a family of experiments (three for WebDriverManager and two for Selenium-Jupiter) with 104 master student participants from the University of Genoa, Italy (across academic years 2021/2022 and 2022/2023) and nine professional participants.
Results:
Results indicate that the adoption of Selenium WebDriver with WebDriverManager significantly reduces setup time for multi-browser test suites from 33% to 50% (depending on the tester experience). Additionally, Selenium-Jupiter reduces test suite development time significantly (20% on average). Although it also decreases total code length, the reduction is relatively small compared to overall code length.
Conclusion:
WebDriverManager and Selenium-Jupiter can be seen as valuable solutions for enhancing testers’ productivity by shortening the time needed to develop test suites and minimizing the amount of code to write.}

A key step for metastatic outgrowth involves the generation of a deeply altered microenvironment (niche) that supports the malignant behavior of cancer cells. The complexity of the metastatic niche has posed a significant challenge in elucidating the underlying programs driving its origin. Here, by focusing on early stages of breast cancer metastasis to the lung in mice, we describe a cancer-dependent chromatin remodeling and activation of developmental programs in alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells within the niche. We show that metastatic cells can prime AT2 cells into a reprogrammed multilineage state. In turn, this cancer-induced reprogramming of AT2 cells promoted stem-like features in cancer cells and enhanced their initiation capacity. In conclusion, we propose the concept of “reflected stemness” as an early phenomenon during metastatic niche initiation, wherein metastatic cells reprogram the local tissue into a stem-like state that enhances intrinsic cancer-initiating potential, creating a positive feedback loop where tumorigenic programs are amplified.}

Infrastructure-as-code (IaC) is the DevOps tactic of managing and provisioning software infrastructures through machine-readable definition files, rather than manual hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.
Objective:
From a maintenance and evolution perspective, the topic has picked the interest of practitioners and academics alike, given the relative scarcity of supporting patterns and practices in the academic literature. At the same time, a considerable amount of gray literature exists on IaC. Thus we aim to characterize IaC and compile a catalog of best and bad practices for widely used IaC languages, all using gray literature materials.
Method:
In this paper, we systematically analyze the industrial gray literature on IaC, such as blog posts, tutorials, white papers using qualitative analysis techniques.
Results:
We proposed a definition for IaC and distilled a broad catalog summarized in a taxonomy consisting of 10 and 4 primary categories for best practices and bad practices, respectively, both language-agnostic and language-specific ones, for three IaC languages, namely Ansible, Puppet, and Chef. The practices reflect implementation issues, design issues, and the violation of/adherence to the essential principles of IaC.
Conclusion:
Our findings reveal critical insights concerning the top languages as well as the best practices adopted by practitioners to address (some of) those challenges. We evidence that the field of development and maintenance IaC is in its infancy and deserves further attention.}

Objective: We present EFLBench, a benchmark and a framework to provide a common ground for the evaluation of feature location techniques in families of systems. Method: EFLBench leverages the efforts made by the Eclipse Community which provides feature-based family artefacts and their plugin-based implementations. Eclipse is an active and non-trivial project and thus, it establishes an unbiased ground truth which is realistic and challenging. Results: EFLBench is publicly available and supports all tasks for feature location techniques integration, benchmark construction and benchmark usage. We demonstrate its usage, simplicity and reproducibility by comparing four techniques in Eclipse releases. As an extension of our previously published work, we consider a decade of Eclipse releases and we also contribute an approach to automatically generate synthetic Eclipse variants to benchmark feature location techniques in tailored settings. We present and discuss three strategies for this automatic generation and we present the results using different settings.

abstract = {Component Based Software Development (CBSD) is focused on assembling existing components to build a software system, with a potential benefit of delivering quality systems by using quality components. It departs from the conventional software development process in that it is integration centric as opposed to development centric. The quality of a component based system using high quality components does not therefore necessarily guarantee a system of high quality, but depends on the quality of its components, and a framework and integration process used. Hence, techniques and methods for quality assurance and assessment of a component based system would be different from those of the traditional software engineering methodology. It is essential to quantify factors that contribute to the overall quality, for instances, the trade off between cost and quality of a component, analytical techniques and formal methods, and quality attribute definitions and measurements. This paper presents a literature survey of component based system quality assurance and assessment; the areas surveyed include formalism, cost estimation, and assessment and measurement techniques for the following quality attributes: performance, reliability, maintainability and testability. The aim of this survey is to help provide a better understanding of CBSD in these aspects in order to facilitate the realisation of its potential benefits of delivering quality systems.}

abstract = {Recent software development methodologies emphasize iterative and incremental evolution to align with stakeholders’ needs. This perpetual and rapid software evolution demands ongoing research into verification practices and technologies that ensure swift responsiveness and effective management of software delta increments. Strategies such as code review have been widely adopted for development and verification, ensuring readability and consistency in the delta increments of software projects. However, the integration of techniques to detect and visually report delta changes within the Graphical User Interface (GUI) software applications remains an underutilized process. In this paper, we set out to achieve two objectives. First, we aim to conduct a comprehensive review of existing studies concerning GUI change detection in desktop, web, and mobile applications to recognize common practices. Second, we introduce a novel change detection tool capable of highlighting delta GUI changes for this diverse range of applications. To accomplish our first objective, we performed a systematic mapping of the literature using the Scopus database. To address the second objective, we designed and developed a GUI change detection tool. This tool simultaneously transits and compares state models inferred by a scriptless testing tool, enabling the detection and highlighting of GUI changes to detect the widgets or functionalities that have been added, removed, or modified. Our study reveals the existence of a multitude of techniques for change detection in specific GUI systems with different objectives. However, there is no widely adopted technique suitable for the diverse range of existing desktop, web, and mobile applications. Our tool and findings demonstrate the effectiveness of using inferred state models to highlight between 8 and 20 GUI changes in software delta increments containing a large number of changes over months and between 4 and 6 GUI changes in delta increments of small iterations performed over multiple weeks. Moreover, some of these changes were recognized by the software developers as GUI failures that required a fix. Finally, we expose the motivation for using this technique to help developers and testers analyze GUI changes to validate delta increments and detect potential GUI failures, thereby fostering knowledge dissemination and paving the way to standard practices.}

abstract = {Context
It is challenging to develop comprehensive, consistent, analyzable requirements models for evolving requirements. This is particularly critical for certain highly interactive types of socio-technical systems that involve a wide range of stakeholders with disparate backgrounds; system success is often dependent on how well local social constraints are addressed in system design.
Objective
This paper describes feasibility research, combining a holistic social system perspective provided by Activity Theory (AT), a psychological paradigm, with existing system development methodologies and tools, specifically goal and scenario modeling.
Method
AT is used to understand the relationships between a system, its stakeholders, and the system’s evolving context. The User Requirements Notation (URN) is used to produce rigorous, analyzable specifications combining goal and scenario models. First, an AT language was developed constraining the framework for automation, second consistency heuristics were developed for constructing and analyzing combined AT/URN models, third a combined AT/URN methodology was developed, and consequently applied to a proof-of-concept system.
Results
An AT language with limited tool support was developed, as was a combined AT/URN methodology. This methodology was applied to an evolving disease management system to demonstrate the feasibility of adapting AT for use in system development with existing methodologies and tools. Bi-directional transformations between the languages allow proposed changes in system design to be propagated to AT models for use in stakeholder discussions regarding system evolution.
Conclusions
The AT framework can be constrained for use in requirements elicitation and combined with URN tools to provide system designs that include social system perspectives. The developed AT/URN methodology can help engineers to track the impact on system design due to requirement changes triggered by changes in the system’s social context. The methodology also allows engineers to assess the impact of proposed system design changes on the social elements of the system context.}

abstract = {The rise of social networking services (SNS) has reshaped communication dynamics in cyberspace, yet it has also exacerbated the proliferation of online hate speech due to the anonymity and fluidity these platforms offer. With manual hate speech detection by human annotators proving costly and time-intensive, the imperative for developing automated recognition algorithms is evident. Leveraging knowledge transfer through fine-tuning pre-trained language models has emerged as a promising strategy in natural language processing. Notably, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and HateBERT, a domain-specific variant, stand out for their ability to glean deep bidirectional representations from extensive corpora. This paper introduces a multichannel model integrating these two language models for multilingual hate speech detection. Furthermore, we explore the efficacy of augmenting input data through translation, ensuring compatibility with the English requirement of the HateBERT model. By evaluating our approach on three non-English datasets alongside an English dataset, we demonstrate achieving state-of-the-art or comparable performance, underscoring the effectiveness of our methodology in combating hate speech across linguistic barriers.}

abstract = {Context: Metamodels evolve over time to accommodate new features, improve existing designs, and fix errors identified in previous releases. One of the obstacles that may limit the adaptation of new metamodels by developers is the extensive manual changes that have been applied to migrate existing models. Recent studies addressed the problem of automating the metamodel/model co-evolution based on manually defined migration rules. The definition of these rules requires the list of changes at the metamodel level which are difficult to fully identify. Furthermore, different possible alternatives may be available to translate a metamodel change to a model change. Thus, it is hard to generalize these co-evolution rules. Objective: We propose an alternative automated approach for the metamodel/model co-evolution. The proposed approach refines an initial model instantiated from the previous metamodel version to make it as conformant as possible to the new metamodel version by finding the best compromise between three objectives, namely minimizing (i) the non-conformities with new metamodel version, (ii) the changes to existing models, and (iii) the textual and structural dissimilarities between the initial and revised models. Method: We formulated the metamodel/model co-evolution as a multi-objective optimization problem to handle the different conflicting objectives using the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) and the Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO). Results: We evaluated our approach on several evolution scenarios extracted from different widely used metamodels. The results confirm the effectiveness of our approach with average manual correctness, precision and recall respectively higher than 91%, 88% and 89% on the different co-evolution scenarios. Conclusion: A comparison with our previous work confirms the out-performance of our multi-objective formulation.}

abstract = {Context
Variability management (VM) is one of the most important activities of software product-line engineering (SPLE), which intends to develop software-intensive systems using platforms and mass customization. VM encompasses the activities of eliciting and representing variability in software artefacts, establishing and managing dependencies among different variabilities, and supporting the exploitation of the variabilities for building and evolving a family of software systems. Software product line (SPL) community has allocated huge amount of effort to develop various approaches to dealing with variability related challenges during the last two decade. Several dozens of VM approaches have been reported. However, there has been no systematic effort to study how the reported VM approaches have been evaluated.
Objective
The objectives of this research are to review the status of evaluation of reported VM approaches and to synthesize the available evidence about the effects of the reported approaches.
Method
We carried out a systematic literature review of the VM approaches in SPLE reported from 1990s until December 2007.
Results
We selected 97 papers according to our inclusion and exclusion criteria. The selected papers appeared in 56 publication venues. We found that only a small number of the reviewed approaches had been evaluated using rigorous scientific methods. A detailed investigation of the reviewed studies employing empirical research methods revealed significant quality deficiencies in various aspects of the used quality assessment criteria. The synthesis of the available evidence showed that all studies, except one, reported only positive effects.
Conclusion
The findings from this systematic review show that a large majority of the reported VM approaches have not been sufficiently evaluated using scientifically rigorous methods. The available evidence is sparse and the quality of the presented evidence is quite low. The findings highlight the areas in need of improvement, i.e., rigorous evaluation of VM approaches. However, the reported evidence is quite consistent across different studies. That means the proposed approaches may be very beneficial when they are applied properly in appropriate situations. Hence, it can be concluded that further investigations need to pay more attention to the contexts under which different approaches can be more beneficial.}

In vivo analysis of murine polyomavirus (MPyV) infection has shown that subtle alterations in PyV–glycan interactions alone can result in dramatic changes in pathogenicity, implying that similar effects will be found for other PyVs. Our discussion will review the assays used for determining virus–glycan binding, and how these relate to known PyV tropism and pathogenesis.}

Objective:
The objective of this study is to propose and empirically evaluate a BDD based process adapted for large-scale projects.
Method:
A technology transfer model was used to propose a BDD based process for large-scale projects. We conducted six workshop sessions to understand the challenges and benefits of BDD. Later, an industrial evaluation was performed for the process with the help of practitioners.
Results:
From our investigations, understanding of a business aspect of requirements, their improved quality, a guide to system-level use-cases, reuse of artifacts, and help for test organization are found as benefits of BDD. Practitioners identified the following challenges: specification and ownership of behaviors, adoption of new tools, the software projects’ scale, and versioning of behaviors. We proposed a process to address these challenges and evaluated the process with the help of practitioners.
Conclusion:
The evaluation proved that BDD could be adapted and used to facilitate interaction in large-scale software projects in the software industry. The feedback from the practitioners helped in improving the proposed process.}

One distinguished feature of such complex interactions is the tight coupling between discrete and continuous interactions, captured by hybrid system models. Due to the complexity of CPSs, providing rigorous and model-based analysis methods and tools for verifying correctness of such systems is of the utmost importance. Model-based testing (MBT) is one such verification technique that can be used for checking the conformance of an implementation of a system to its specification (model). In this chapter, we first review the main concepts and techniques in MBT. Subsequently, we review the most common modeling formalisms for CPSs, with focus on hybrid system models. Subsequently, we provide a brief overview of conformance relations and conformance testing techniques for CPSs.}

Commonly, there is little reuse of existing frameworks beyond the development teams and not much sharing of science components across frameworks. We believe this must change to enable researchers and assessors to form complex workflows that leverage the current environmental science available. In this paper, we characterize the model integration process and compare integration practices of different groups. We highlight key strategies, features, standards, and practices that can be employed by developers to increase reuse and interoperability of science software components and systems.}

The concept integrates existing software platforms and services for simplified app development that can be reused for other target applications. This developmental method also facilitates app portability, through the use of common components found across multiple mobile platforms, and scalability, through the loose coupling of services. The results are demonstrated by the development of native Android and cross-platform web apps, in a case study that presents an mHealth solution for endocrine hormone therapy (EHT).

Rules are the mechanism most often used to enable user customization of the environment. However, the expressiveness of the rules available to users in editing and other tools is usually either limited or the available rule editing interfaces are not designed for end-users with low skills in programming. This means we have to look for interaction techniques and new ways to define user customization rules. This paper describes a generic and flexible meta-model to support expressive rules enhanced with data flow expressions that will graphically support the definition of rules without writing code. An empirical study was conducted on the ease of understanding of the visual data flow expressions, which are the key elements in our rule proposal. The visual dataflow language was compared to its corresponding textual version in terms of comprehension and ease of learning by teenagers in exercises involving calculations, modifications, writing and detecting equivalences in expressions in both languages. Although the subjects had some previous experience in editing mathematical expressions on spreadsheets, the study found their performance with visual dataflows to be significantly better in calculation and modification exercises. This makes our dataflow approach a promising mechanism for expressing user-customized reactive behavior in Ambient Intelligence (AmI) environments. The performance of the rule matching processor was validated by means of two stress tests to ensure that the meta-model approach adopted would be able to scale up with the number of types and instances in the space.}

Case–control studies related to our study theme were enrolled for meta-analysis and Comprehensive Meta-analysis 2.0 (CMA 2.0) was used for statistical analysis. After treatment, DHEAS levels in depression patients were significantly increased, while before and after treatment, DHEAS levels were all lower in depression patients than in controls (all P<0.001); further analysis on age revealed that DHEAS levels were decreased with the rising of age. Meta-analysis results suggested that serum DHEAS levels (ng/mL) were significantly higher in healthy controls compared to depression patients (SMD=0.777, 95%CI=0.156–1.399, P=0.014). In conclusion, our study suggests that serum DHEAS levels are associated with the development of depression and it decreased with the rising of age.}

In this paper, we propose an extension to BDDs, referred to as OR-BDDs, that enables the accurate modelling of the circuit structure in a compact manner. We show how to construct the minimal OR-BDDs. We introduce the fault model for OR-BDDs and show it's one-to-one correspondence with the structural stuck-at-value model. Finally, we present an algorithm for test pattern generation that uses OR-BDDs and their fault model. This algorithm discovers efficiently circuit redundancy and enables 100% fault coverage for all detectable faults by a compact set of test vectors.}

As discussed at the outset of this chapter, companies often turn to the research organizations, the vendors, or both. However, the vendors are clearly self-interested, and the research organizations receive much of their funding from the vendors and are not articulating a comprehensive vision for how IT enablement tooling must interoperate. Hence, this chapter. Enablement tools and architectures are important and must be given their due. This chapter has several goals. First, it discusses the generic categories of internal IT enablement systems and potential interactions and overlaps. One issue in particular in this area is the proliferation of single-point systems. Providing a framework to support such efforts is a primary goal of this chapter. Finally, the use of a common logical process and data model can assist in the integration of the vendor packages available, and in particular the master data subjects be clearly established with defined systems of record so that the diverse systems can be aligned.}

A formal representation of the VHDL process statement is described and the concept of event-driven simulation and its impact on test generation are discussed using the formal representation. The new test generation method generates realistic tests by ignoring the sensitivity list of a process statement and identifying the type of the behavior described by the statements inside the process statement (two types of behavior - synchronous and asynchronous, are defined.). A systematic way of converting a VHDL model to one suitable for checking the validity of the generated tests is presented. A method of further compacting the generated tests is also presented. Finally, an approach to generating tests in the presence of different types of bus resolution functions is discussed.}

Nanoparticles of tacrolimus (FK506) might interact with human SP-A, which is the most abundant lipoprotein in the alveolar fluid. This study was undertaken to determine whether the formation of FK506/SP-A complexes interferes with FK506 immunosuppressive actions on stimulated human macrophage-like U937 cells. We found that SP-A was avidly bound to FK506 (Kd=35±4nM), as determined by solid phase–binding assays and dynamic light scattering. Free FK506, at concentrations ⩽1μM, had no effect on the inflammatory response of LPS-stimulated U937 macrophages. However, coincubation of FK506 and SP-A, at concentrations where each component alone did not affect LPS-stimulated macrophage response, significantly inhibited LPS-induced NF-κB activation and TNF-alpha secretion. Free FK506, but not FK506/SP-A, functioned as substrate for the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein. FK506 bound to SP-A was delivered to macrophages by endocytosis, since several endocytosis inhibitors blocked FK506/SP-A anti-inflammatory effects. This process depended partly on SP-A binding to its receptor, SP-R210. These results indicate that FK506/SP-A complexes have a greater anti-inflammatory effect than either FK506 or SP-A alone and suggest that SP-A strengthened FK506 anti-inflammatory activity by facilitating FK506 entrance into the cell, overcoming P-glycoprotein.}

With the high consumption of running applications at scale, doing so solely to optimize their performance is particularly costly. Having inexpensive but faithful predictions of expected performance could be a great help for researchers and system administrators. The methodology we propose decouples the complexity of the platform, which is captured through statistical models of the performance of its main components (MPI communications, BLAS operations), from the complexity of adaptive applications by emulating the application and skipping regular non-MPI parts of the code. We demonstrate the capability of our method with High-Performance Linpack (HPL), the benchmark used to rank supercomputers in the TOP500, which requires careful tuning. We briefly present (1) how the open-source version of HPL can be slightly modified to allow a fast emulation on a single commodity server at the scale of a supercomputer. Then we present (2) an extensive (in)validation study that compares simulation with real experiments and demonstrates our ability to predict the performance of HPL within a few percent consistently. This study allows us to identify the main modeling pitfalls (e.g., spatial and temporal node variability or network heterogeneity and irregular behavior) that need to be considered. Last, we show (3) how our “surrogate” allows studying several subtle HPL parameter optimization problems while accounting for uncertainty on the platform.}

Objective: A previous meta-analysis carried out on the predictive ability of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) showed that independent AMH may be a useful initial diagnostic test for PCOS. The aims of this study were to update the meta-analysis and to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of AMH when it replaces polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM) in the Rotterdam criteria. Methods: Two independent reviewers searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, and the Web of Science databases systematically to identify relevant articles by using the key words “anti-Müllerian hormone” and “polycystic ovary syndrome.” The deadline for manuscript inclusion was July 31, 2018. A random effects model was used and subgroup analysis and meta regression were performed to identify possible sources of heterogeneity. The methodologic quality of each study was assessed by QUADAS-2 and funnel plot asymmetry test. Results: According to the inclusion criteria, 29 studies were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) for AMH alone detecting PCOS were 0.76 (95% confidence interval &lsqb;CI] 0.71 to 0.81), 0.86 (95% CI 0.82 to 0.90) and 20 (95% CI 12 to 33), respectively. When AMH replaces polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM) for the diagnosis of PCOS, the pooled sensitivity, specificity, and DOR rose to 0.93 (95% CI 0.89 to 0.96), 0.99 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.00), and 1,634 (95% CI 217 to 12,324), respectively. The area under the summary receiver-operating characteristic curve for AMH alone and for AMH replacing PCOM detecting PCOS were 0.88 (95% CI 0.85 to 0.91) and 0.97 (95% CI 0.95 to 0.98), respectively, which was found to be significantly different (Z = 4.89, P<.01). Conclusion: When AMH replaces PCOM in the Rotterdam criteria, the diagnostic efficacy for polycystic ovary syndrome is better.

abstract = {Background
The circulating pool of estrone-sulfate is considered as a “reservoir” of slowly-metabolized estrogen that can be exploited for assessing overall individual estrogenicity. The aim of this study was to develop a rapid and sensitive liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry assay for the determination of estrone-sulfate, suitable for routine clinical investigations.
Methods
The proposed assay is based on a simple protein precipitation procedure and on a fast measurement with a triple–quadrupole mass spectrometer operating in negative ion mode and in multiple reaction monitoring. The method was assessed for intra- and inter-day precision, accuracy, recovery, and clinical suitability. A comparison with available radioimmunoassay was also performed.
Results
The LC–MS/MS method is able to detect estrone-sulfate concentrations ≤1pg/mL and has a low limit of quantification of 7.8pg/mL. Intra- and inter-day precision and accuracy were less than 10.5% and 5.0% respectively. The recovery was in the range of 93%–110%. When compared with radioimmunoassay the method resulted more accurate and therefore more suitable for quantifying the estrone-sulfate in different clinical settings, including patients treated with aromatase inhibitors.
Conclusions
The proposed LC–MS/MS method represents a convincing alternative to the immunoassay for a fast, cost-effective and reliable measurement of estrone-sulfate in routine clinical investigations and in large epidemiological studies. It may contribute in shedding a new light on the diagnostic value of estrone-sulfate in normal and pathological conditions.}

The use of these web services in the development process of WSbWAs can help overcome many problems of software use, deployment and evolution. Although the cost-effective software engineering of WSbWAs is potentially a very rewarding area, not much work has been done to accomplish short time to market conditions by viewing and dealing with WSbWAs as software products that can be derived from a common infrastructure and assets with a captured specific abstraction in the domain. Both Product Line Engineering (PLE) and Agile Methods (AMs), albeit with different philosophies, are software engineering approaches that can significantly shorten the time to market and increase the quality of products. Using the PLE approach we built, at the domain engineering level, a WSbWA-specific lightweight product-line architecture and combined it, at the application engineering level, with an Agile Method that uses a domain-specific visual language with direct manipulation and extraction capabilities of web services to perform customization and calibration of a product or WSBWA for a specific customer. To assess the effectiveness of our approach we designed and implemented a tool that we used to investigate the return on investment of the activities related to PLE and AMs. Details of our proposed approach, the related tool developed, and the experimental study performed are presented in this article together with a discussion of planned directions of future work.}

A number of Systematic Mapping Studies (SMSs) that cover Software Engineering (SE) are reported in literature. Tertiary studies synthesize the secondary studies to provide a holistic view of an area.
Objectives
We synthesize SMSs in SE to provide insights into existing SE areas and to investigate the trends and quality of SMSs.
Methodology
We use Systematic Literature Review protocol to analyze and map the SMSs in SE, till August 2017, to SE Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK).
Results
We analyze 210 SMSs and results show that: (1) Software design and construction are most active areas in SE; (2) Some areas lack SMSs, including mathematical foundations, software configuration management, and SE tools; (3) The quality of SMSs is improving with time; (4) SMSs in journals have higher quality than SMSs in conferences and are cited more often; (5) Low quality in SMSs can be attributed to a lack of quality assessment in SMSs and not reporting information about the primary studies.

abstract = {Most formal models are used in detailed design and focus on a single domain. Few effective approaches exist that can effectively tie these lower level models to a high level system model during design space exploration. This complicates the validation of high level system requirements during detailed design. In this paper, we define requirements for a high level model that is firstly driven by key systems engineering challenges present in industry and secondly connects to several formal and domain specific models used in model-based design. We analysed part of the systems engineering process at a company developing complex systems, by observing the design process and by analysing design documentation and development databases. By generalizing these observations, we identified several high level systems engineering challenges. They are compared to literature, focusing on reported systems engineering challenges and on existing approaches that incorporate high level models in model-based systems engineering. Finally, we argue that high level system models supporting design space exploration should be able to communicate information regarding design trade-offs (e.g. safety versus ease of use) effectively in a multidisciplinary setting. In our outlook, we propose how to continue our research, by recommending further research and defining a research question.}

Goanna is based on formal software analysis techniques such as model checking, static analysis and SMT solving. The commercial version of Goanna is currently deployed in a wide range of organizations around the world. Moreover, the underlying technology is licensed to an independent software vendor with tens of thousands of customers, making it possibly one of the largest deployments of automated formal methods technology. This paper explains some of the challenges as well as the positive results that we encountered in the technology transfer process. In particular, we provide some background on the design decisions and techniques to deal with large industrial code bases, we highlight engineering challenges and efforts that are typically outside of a more academic setting, and we address core aspects of the bigger picture for transferring formal techniques into commercial products, namely, the adoption of such technology and the value for purchasing organizations. While we provide a particular focus on Goanna and our experience with that underlying technology, we believe that many of those aspects hold true for the wider field of formal analysis and verification technology and its adoption in industry.}

abstract = {In many species, territorial behavior is limited to the breeding season and is tightly coupled to circulating gonadal steroid levels. In contrast, both male and female red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) are highly aggressive in both the breeding and non-breeding seasons in defense of food stores on their individual territories throughout the boreal and northern forests of North America. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), an androgen precursor, is secreted from the adrenal cortex in some mammals, and DHEA has been linked to aggression in non-breeding songbirds. Here, we examined plasma DHEA levels in a natural population of red squirrels in the Yukon, Canada. Plasma DHEA levels in both males and females reached high concentrations (up to 16.952ng/ml in males and 14.602ng/ml in females), markedly exceeding plasma DHEA concentrations in laboratory rats and mice and similar to plasma DHEA concentrations in some primates. Circulating DHEA levels showed both seasonal and yearly variation. Seasonal variation in male plasma DHEA levels was negatively correlated with testes mass. Yearly variation in male DHEA levels was positively correlated with population density. In both males and females, circulating DHEA rapidly increased after ACTH treatment, implying an adrenal origin. This is the first examination of plasma DHEA concentrations in a wild rodent and the first field experiment on the regulation of plasma DHEA in any wild mammal. These data lay the foundation for future studies on the role of DHEA in non-breeding territoriality in this species and other mammals.}

A model transformation is a program, written in a transformation language, to convert a model into another model or code. Similar to any other program, model transformations need to be verified. The problem is that some transformation errors, e.g., logical errors, can only be detected via execution. Our focus in this research is on the Epsilon Transformation Language (ETL), one of the most extensively used model transformation languages. Lack of approaches to detecting logical errors in ETL transformations is a gap which needs to be addressed. In this paper, we present an approach to symbolic execution of ETL transformations and detecting logical errors. The approach uses a constraint solver to assess the satisfiability of a path condition and generates a symbolic metamodel footprint which can be used to detect errors. The approach is corroborated by a tool that is integrated with Eclipse. To evaluate the approach, the precision and recall are calculated for two well-known case studies. The scalability is evaluated via nine experiments. The usefulness and usability aspects are evaluated in a subjective manner. The results show the improvement in the field of verifying ETL transformations.}

abstract = {In the quest for predicting fertility of an individual, enhancing semen handling, dilution and storage protocols, and understanding the impact of environment and, andrologists have changed their approaches to semen analysis. The technologies used today are fast developing and readily implemented in research. Semen is one of a few naturally occurring monocellular suspensions, so sperm function analysis by flow cytometry (FC) and utilization of fluorochromes is an ideal technique for high throughput, objective and accurate analysis. The complementary use of microscopical assessments by Computer-Assisted Semen Analysis (CASA), where sperm cell parameters can be objectively assessed is equally important. The objectivity and repeatability of these techniques have driven research on the function, identification of heterogeneity and fertility of the ejaculate. The wealth of knowledge obtained from the application of these powerful methods has changed our view of the spermatozoon. Although there is some application of these methods in the industry producing boar semen for artificial insemination (AI) and to eliminate sires of sub-standard semen quality, uptake of advanced methods is still slow. Instruments are becoming cheaper and technically more user friendly. Standardization of methodology and optimization of instrument settings is important for full implementation of these systems, including comparison between labs. This review provides an update on two technologies: flow cytometry and CASA for objective analysis of boar semen quality.}

In all of these species, males undergo short-day induced regression of the reproductive system. Some studies, however, suggest that the effect of photoperiod on aggression may be independent of reproductive responses. We examined the effects of photoperiod on aggressive behavior in California mice (Peromyscus californicus), which do not display reproductive responsiveness to short days. As expected, short days had no effect on plasma testosterone. Estrogen receptor alpha and estrogen receptor beta immunostaining did not differ in the lateral septum, medial preoptic area, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, or medial amygdala. However, males housed in short days were significantly more aggressive than males housed in long days. Similar to previous work in beach mice (Peromyscus polionotus), estradiol rapidly increased aggression when male California mice were housed in short days but not when housed in long days. These data suggest that the effects of photoperiod on aggression and estrogen signaling are independent of reproductive responses. The rapid action of estradiol on aggression in short-day mice also suggests that nongenomic mechanisms mediate the effects of estrogens in short days.}

There is an immediate industrial need to bridge the gap between such a sequence agnostic model and a standardized model verifier so that model checking can be performed in the requirement analysis phase itself. In this paper, we first spell out the Naive Algorithm that generates all possible finite state models corresponding to a given i* model. The growth of the finite state model space can be mapped to the problem of finding the number of possible paths between the Least Upper Bound (LUB) and the Greatest Lower Bound (GLB) of a k-dimensional hypercube lattice structure. The mathematics for doing a quantitative analysis of the space growth has also been presented. The Naive Algorithm has its main drawback in the hyperexponential growth of the model space. The Semantic Implosion Algorithm is proposed as a solution to the hyperexponential problem. This algorithm exploits the temporal information embedded within the i* model of an enterprise to reduce the rate of growth of the finite state model space. A comparative quantitative analysis between the two approaches concludes the superiority of the Semantic Implosion Algorithm.}

abstract = {Plasma testosterone can play an important role in promoting aggressive behaviors relating to territory defense in breeding male birds. Some birds defend territories also during the non-breeding phase, when testosterone circulates at basal levels. In such species, plasma levels of the pro-hormone dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) may support non-breeding territoriality by acting as a local substrate for sex steroids. To test this possible role of plasma DHEA, we examined the seasonal DHEA profile of male (and female) European nuthatches Sitta europaea: a male and female nuthatch pair will defend an all-purpose territory throughout the year. We hypothesized that plasma DHEA would be detectable in wintering nuthatches with a territory. However, only ca. half of the territorial wintering males (and females) displayed detectable DHEA levels, suggesting that plasma DHEA is not a major sex steroid precursor during non-breeding. Further, among hatching-year birds, plasma DHEA was significantly lower in territorial birds than in “floaters”, i.e., subordinate birds without a territory. To experimentally examine the role of DHEA in non-breeding territoriality, we treated adult wintering males with DHEA and measured effects on aggressive responses to conspecific challenge. DHEA treatment elevated plasma levels of DHEA (and testosterone), but did not enhance territorial behaviors or their persistence. Taken together, our data suggest that DHEA (and, indeed, sex steroids per se) do not regulate non-breeding territoriality in the nuthatch. Given that territorial aggression in nuthatches is expressed year-round, a hormone for its activation may be redundant.}

First, we manually reviewed 161 papers and in the second phase of our method, we conducted a more extensive semi-automatic classification of papers spanning the years 2001–2015 and 5196 papers. Results from both review steps was used to: i) identify and analyse the predominant practices in ESE (e.g., using t-test or ANOVA), as well as relevant trends in usage of specific statistical methods (e.g., nonparametric tests and effect size measures) and, ii) develop a conceptual model for a statistical analysis workflow with suggestions on how to apply different statistical methods as well as guidelines to avoid pitfalls. Lastly, we confirm existing claims that current ESE practices lack a standard to report practical significance of results. We illustrate how practical significance can be discussed in terms of both the statistical analysis and in the practitioner’s context.}

abstract = {Over the last decade, the Internet has grown at a tremendous speed in both size and complexity. Nowadays, a large number of important services – for instance e-commerce, healthcare and many others – depend on the availability of the underlying network. Clearly, service interruptions due to network problems may have a severe impact. On the long way towards the Future Internet, the complexity will grow even further. Therefore, new ideas and concepts must be evaluated thoroughly, and particularly in realistic, real-world Internet scenarios, before they can be deployed for production networks. For this purpose, various testbeds – for instance PlanetLab, GpENI or G-Lab – have been established and are intensively used for research. However, all of these testbeds lack the support for so-called multi-homing. Multi-homing denotes the connection of a site to multiple Internet service providers, in order to achieve redundancy. Clearly, with the need for network availability, there is a steadily growing demand for multi-homing. The idea of the NorNet Core project is to establish a Future Internet research testbed with multi-homed sites, in order to allow researchers to perform experiments with multi-homed systems. Particular use cases for this testbed include realistic experiments in the areas of multi-path routing, load balancing, multi-path transport protocols, overlay networks and network resilience. In this paper, we introduce the NorNet Core testbed as well as its architecture.}

First, we introduce the area and explain the reasons why the software development industry begun to move into this direction in the late 1990s. Section 2 characterizes the research trends on Agile software development. This section helps understand the relevance of Agile software development in the research literature. Section 3 provides a walk through the roots of Agile and Lean thinking, as they originally emerged in manufacturing. Section 4 develops into Agile and Lean for software development. Main characteristics and most popular methods and practices of Agile and Lean software development are developed in this section. Section 5 centers on rapid releases, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment, the latest advances in the area to get speed. The concepts of DevOps, as a means to take full (end-to-end) advantage of Agile and Lean, and Lean start-up, as an approach to foster innovation, are the focus of the two following 6 DevOps, 7 The Lean Startup Movement. Finally, Section 8 focuses on two important aspects of Agile and Lean software development: (1) metrics to guide decision making and (2) technical debt as a mechanism to gain business advantage.

abstract = {In our days, having all the necessary literature and methods for the implementation of street lighting design, it is possible to propose sustainable solutions that offer benefits in energy saving, the environment and optimization of living conditions. However, so far, research has shown that studies either follow the Standards or are carried out empirically, taking into consideration certain parameters at a time rather than all the parameters concerning a street lighting design. The present work's aim is to elucidate the critical design parameters involved in road lighting analysis, covering both theoretical aspects of the design process and practical implementation in field applications, highlighting their importance in terms of energy savings and their contribution to sustainable development. The analysis concluded in a large number of parameters which form a lighting analysis. It was noted that many researchers tend to adopt an one-sided perspective on the subject by focusing on specific parameters within a single case category. This approach does not provide reliable results regarding the overall energy efficiency and savings of a system. Parameters such as energy indicators, adaptive lighting, road surface characteristics, mesopic vision, etc. require further investigation to explore efficient and sustainable solutions that prioritize both human well-being and environmental impact. Simultaneously, the frequent use of new technologies has led to their overuse, that sometimes has as a concequence the increase of energy consumption and operational cost rather than reducing it. It is also obvious that design loses its value compared with technology that continuously gains ground. At the moment, by having all the relevant information, it seems to be the time to proceed to a new holistic design approach, that combines all the necessary parameters that formulate a road lighting analysis. This approach aims to deliver more accurate results, contributing to a more efficient and sustainable urban environment.
Contribution to science
A systematic scientific literature review on energy management and energy saving in road lighting is conducted, investigating parameters such as energy indicators, adaptive lighting, mesopic vision, road surface, design parameters, on-site elements and technology-equipment that constitute a road lighting study, identifying the lacking points and highlighting the areas for further research towards a more efficient, sustainable and environmentally friendly urban environment.}

Considering that many Android apps are in the same category and share similar workflows, in this paper, we propose a user behavior pattern mining and reuse approach across similar Android apps, thereby reducing the cost of understanding new apps. Particularly, for a specific new app, to figure out its typical behaviors, the behavior patterns that refer to the frequently-occurring workflows can be obtained from another similar app and transferred to this app. Moreover, to reuse the behavior patterns on this app, a semantic-based event fuzzy matching strategy and continuous workflow generation strategy are raised to generate workflows for this app. To evaluate our approach’s effectiveness and rationality, we conduct a series of experiments on 25 Android apps in five categories. Furthermore, the experimental results show that 88.3% of behavior patterns can be completely reused on similar apps, and the generated workflows cover 89.1% of the top 20% of important states.}

abstract = {Summary
Like many scientific disciplines, dynamical biochemical modeling is hindered by irreproducible results. This limits the utility of biochemical models by making them difficult to understand, trust, or reuse. We comprehensively list the best practices that biochemical modelers should follow to build reproducible biochemical model artifacts—all data, model descriptions, and custom software used by the model—that can be understood and reused. The best practices provide advice for all steps of a typical biochemical modeling workflow in which a modeler collects data; constructs, trains, simulates, and validates the model; uses the predictions of a model to advance knowledge; and publicly shares the model artifacts. The best practices emphasize the benefits obtained by using standard tools and formats and provides guidance to modelers who do not or cannot use standards in some stages of their modeling workflow. Adoption of these best practices will enhance the ability of researchers to reproduce, understand, and reuse biochemical models.}

In this work, we focus on generating counterfactual explanations for deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents which operate in visual input environments like Atari. We introduce counterfactual state explanations, a novel example-based approach to counterfactual explanations based on generative deep learning. Specifically, a counterfactual state illustrates what minimal change is needed to an Atari game image such that the agent chooses a different action. We also evaluate the effectiveness of counterfactual states on human participants who are not machine learning experts. Our first user study investigates if humans can discern if the counterfactual state explanations are produced by the actual game or produced by a generative deep learning approach. Our second user study investigates if counterfactual state explanations can help non-expert participants identify a flawed agent; we compare against a baseline approach based on a nearest neighbor explanation which uses images from the actual game. Our results indicate that counterfactual state explanations have sufficient fidelity to the actual game images to enable non-experts to more effectively identify a flawed RL agent compared to the nearest neighbor baseline and to having no explanation at all.}

Turkey has a vibrant software industry and it is important to characterize and understand the state of its SE practices. Our objective is to characterize and grasp a high-level view on type of SE practices in the Turkish software industry. To achieve this objective, we systematically designed an online survey with 46 questions based on our past experience in the Canadian and Turkish contexts and using the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK). Two hundred and two practicing software engineers from the Turkish software industry participated in the survey. The survey results reveal important and interesting findings about SE practices in Turkey and beyond. They also help track the profession of SE, and suggest areas for improved training, education and research. Among the findings are the followings: (1) The military and defense software sectors are quite prominent in Turkey, especially in the capital Ankara region, and many SE practitioners work for those companies. (2) 54% of the participants reported not using any software size measurement methods, while 33% mentioned that they have measured lines of code (LOC). (3) In terms of effort, after the development phase (on average, 31% of overall project effort), software testing, requirements, design and maintenance phases come next and have similar average values (14%, 12%, 12% and 11% respectively). (4) Respondents experience the most challenge in the requirements phase. (5) Waterfall, as a rather old but still widely used lifecycle model, is the model that more than half of the respondents (53%) use. The next most preferred lifecycle models are incremental and Agile/lean development models with usage rates of 38% and 34%, respectively. (6) The Waterfall and Agile methodologies have slight negative correlations, denoting that if one is used in a company, the other will less likely to be used. The results of our survey will be of interest to SE professionals both in Turkey and world-wide. It will also benefit researchers in observing the latest trends in SE industry identifying the areas of strength and weakness, which would then hopefully encourage further industry–academia collaborations in those areas.}

abstract = {Background/Aims
The contribution of oxidative stress to the pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is still poorly elucidated. This study investigated the relationship between oxidative stress, insulin resistance, steatosis and fibrosis in CHC.
Methods
IgG against malondialdehyde-albumin adducts and HOMA-IR were measured as markers of oxidative stress and insulin resistance, respectively, in 107 consecutive CHC patients.
Results
Oxidative stress was present in 61% of the patients, irrespective of age, gender, viral load, BMI, aminotransferase level, histology activity index (HAI) and HCV genotype. Insulin resistance and steatosis were evident in 80% and 70% of the patients, respectively. In the patients infected by HCV genotype non-3, but not in those with genotype 3 infection HOMA-IR (p<0.03), steatosis (p=0.02) and fibrosis (p<0.05) were higher in the subjects with oxidative stress than in those without. Multiple regression analysis revealed that, HOMA-IR (p<0.01), fibrosis (p<0.01) and oxidative stress (p<0.05) were independently associated with steatosis, whereas steatosis was independently associated with oxidative stress (p<0.03) and HOMA-IR (p<0.02). Steatosis (p<0.02) and HAI (p=0.007) were also independent predictors of fibrosis.
Conclusions
In patients infected by HCV genotype non-3, oxidative stress and insulin resistance contribute to steatosis, which in turn exacerbates both insulin resistance and oxidative stress and accelerates the progression of fibrosis.}

While such integration can be relatively straightforward for a single instance – that is, the integration of a specific knowledge resource in a specific clinical information system – the challenge lies in the fact that both knowledge resources and clinical information systems are quite diverse. Consequently, there is no single knowledge integration architecture that can address all circumstances. However, there are several architectural patterns for knowledge integration that can, taken together, enable the effective integration of knowledge resources into applications. The primary purpose of this chapter, then, is to outline the main CDS knowledge integration architectures that are available and to detail the pros and cons of each approach. The appropriateness of a given architecture for a particular organization depends on a variety of factors, including the existing clinical information system infrastructure and the type of CDS capability involved (e.g. real-time vs. non-real-time applications. These various approaches are outlined here, with special attention being placed on knowledge integration architectures aligned with broad trends in the IT landscape, such as service-oriented architectures, cloud-based computing, and app-based software ecosystems. The chapter also discusses how CDS architectures must align with larger changes in the health care industry as a whole, as shifting health care reimbursement models are requiring continuity of care across multiple organizations and health IT systems centered around patients and populations rather than care episodes at individual care settings.}

Mutations in NOTCH2 have also recently been connected to Hajdu-Cheney syndrome, a dominant disorder causing focal bone destruction, osteoporosis, craniofacial morphology and renal cysts. Mutations in the NOTCH1 receptor are associated with several types of cardiac disease and mutations in NOTCH3 cause the dominant adult onset disorder CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy), a vascular disorder with onset in the 4th or 5th decades. Studies of these human disorders and their inheritance patterns and types of mutations reveal insights into the mechanisms of Notch signaling.}

We use the identified requirements to both further elaborate on the semantic web agent motivating use case scenario, and to summarise different perspectives on the requirements from the semantic web agent literature. We subsequently propose a hybrid semantic web agent architecture, and use the various components and subcomponents in order to provide a focused discussion in relation to existing semantic web standards and community activities. Finally, we highlight open research opportunities and challenges and take a broader perspective of the research by discussing the potential for intelligent software web agents as an enabling technology for emerging domains, such as digital assistants, cloud computing, and the internet of things.}

Non-fouling substrates were prepared by immersion of gold substrates in (1-Mercapto-11-undecyl)tetra(ethylene glycol) thiol solutions. These surfaces were activated with N,N′-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) at different concentrations (0, 0.03, 0.3, 3 and 30mg/ml) and an anti-human IgG, Fc specific fragment antibody (Ab) was covalently bound to EG4-SAMs to guarantee the correct exposure of the Notch ligand Jagged-1/Fc chimera (Jag-1). The presence of Ab and Jag-1 was confirmed by radiolabeling, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), ellipsometry and ELISA. The biological activity of Jag-1-Ab-SAMs was assessed by real-time PCR for Hes-1 family gene expression, a Notch pathway target gene, in HL-60 cell line. Results have shown an increase of the amount of immobilized Ab with increasing surface activator concentrations. Jag-1 concentration also increases with Ab concentration. Interestingly, a higher Jagged-1 exposure and fold increase in Hes-1 expression were obtained for surfaces activated with the lowest concentration of CDI (0.03mg/ml). These results illustrate the great importance of ligands orientation and exposure, when compared with density. This investigation brings new insights into Notch signaling mechanisms. In particular, Jag-1-Ab-SAMs have shown to be adequate model surfaces to study Notch pathway activation and may provide a basis to develop new interfaces in biomaterials to control Notch mechanism in different cell systems.}

abstract = {Milk oligosaccharides (OS)—free complex carbohydrates—confer unique health benefits to the nursing neonate. Though human digestive enzymes cannot degrade these sugars, they provide nourishment to specific commensal microbes and act as decoys to prevent the adhesion of pathogenic micro-organisms to gastrointestinal cells. At present, the limited quantities of human milk oligosaccharides (HMO) impede research on these molecules and their potential applications in functional food formulations. Considerable progress has been made in the study of OS structures; however, the synthetic pathways leading to their synthesis in the mammary gland are poorly understood. Recent studies show that complex OS with fucose and N-acetyl neuraminic acid (key structural elements of HMO bioactivity) exist in goat milk. Polymorphisms in the CSN1S1 locus, which is responsible for synthesis of αs1-casein, affect lipid and casein micelle structure in goat milk. The present study sought to determine whether CSN1S1 polymorphisms also influence goat milk oligosaccharide (GMO) production and secretion. The GMO compositions of thirty-two goat milk samples, half of which were from genotype A/A (αs1-casein producers) and half from genotype O/O (αs1-casein non-producers), were determined with nanoflow liquid chromatography high-accuracy mass spectrometry. This study represents the most exhaustive characterization of GMO to date. A systematic and comprehensive GMO library was created, consolidating information available in the literature with the new findings. Nearly 30 GMO, 11 of which were novel, were confirmed via tandem mass spectrometric analyses. Six fucosylated OS were identified; 4 of these matched HMO compositions and three were identified for the first time in goat milk. Importantly, multivariate statistical analysis demonstrated that the OS profiles of the A/A and O/O genotype milks could be discriminated by the fucosylated OS. Quantitative analysis revealed that the goat milk samples contained 1.17g/L of OS; however, their concentration in milks from A/A and O/O genotypes was not different. This study provides evidence of a genetic influence on specific OS biosynthesis but not total OS production. The presence of fucosylated GMO suggests that goat milk represents a potential source of bioactive milk OS suitable as a functional food ingredient.}

Activating mutations of the transmembrane receptor NOTCH1 are common in precursor T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). We systematically analyzed the impact of activating NOTCH1 mutations on early treatment response and long-term outcome in 157 patients with T-ALL of the pediatric ALL–Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) 2000 study. We confirm previous results that NOTCH1 mutations occur in more than 50% of T-ALL in children. In 82 patients (82/157; 52.2%), activating NOTCH1 mutations were identified either in the heterodimerization (55/82; 67.1%), in the PEST (13/82; 15.9%), or in both domains (14/82; 17.0%). The presence of NOTCH1 mutations was significantly correlated with a good prednisone response and favorable minimal residual disease (MRD) kinetics, which was independent from sex, age, white blood cell count, and T-cell immunophenotype at the time of diagnosis. Furthermore, activating NOTCH1 mutations specified a large subgroup of patients with an excellent prognosis. These findings indicate that in the context of the ALL-BFM 2000 treatment strategy, NOTCH1 mutations predict a more rapid early treatment response and a favorable long-term outcome in children with T-ALL.}

This approach works and is conceptually very clean, but comes with a major quid pro quo: integration of AOP tools with the build system proves an important issue. This leads to the question of how to reconcile the notion of modular reasoning within traditional build systems with a programming paradigm which breaks this notion.}

abstract = {Although transplantation of pancreatic islets is a promising approach for treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus, the engraftment efficiency of these islets is limited by host immune responses. Extensive efforts have been made to immunoisolate these islets by introducing barriers on the islet surface. To date, these barriers have not successfully protected islets from attack by the immune system. In addition, the inevitable permeability of an islet capsule cannot prevent filtration by proinflammatory cytokines and islet self-antigens. Thus, we have developed a surface engineering approach for localized immonumodulation of the islet microenvironment. Jagged-1 (JAG-1), as a potent immunomodulatory factor, was immobilized on the islet surface by mediation of a double-layer of heterobifunctional poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG). Immobilization and functionality of JAG-1 on PEGylated islet surfaces were established. When co-cultured with splenocytes, the JAG-1 conjugated islets induced a significant increase in regulatory T cells and regulated the cytokine levels produced by immune cells. The results demonstrated that JAG-1 immobilization could improve immunoprotection of pancreatic islets by localized modulation of the immune milieu from an inflammatory to an anti-inflammatory state. We also evaluated the effects of surface modification of these islets by JAG-1 in a xenotransplantation model. The transplanted JAG-1/PEG/islets group showed a significantly reduced blood glucose levels compared with the control group of diabetic mice during the acute phase of the immune response to the transplanted islets. Our results demonstrated that surface modification has the potential to shift the immune system from an inflammatory to anti-inflammatory milieu and may offer a new prospective for immunoprotection of pancreatic islets.}

This paper aims to investigate the application of unsupervised machine learning in the international location decision (ILD). This paper addresses the need for a fast, quantitative and dynamic location decision framework.
Design/methodology/approach
Unsupervised machine learning technique, i.e. k-means clustering, is used to carry out the analysis. In total, 24 different indicators of 94 countries, categorized into five groups, have been used in the analysis. After the clustering, the clusters have been compared and scored to select the feasible countries.
Findings
A new framework is developed based on k-means clustering that can be used in ILD. This method provides a quantitative output without personal subjectivity. The indicators can be easily added or extracted based on the preferences of the decision-makers. Hence, it was found out that the unsupervised machine learning, i.e. k-means clustering, is a fast and flexible decision support framework that can be used in ILD.
Research limitations/implications
Limitations include the generality of selected indicators and clustering algorithm used. The use of other methods and parameters may lead to alternate results.
Originality/value
The framework developed through the research intends to assist the decision-makers in deciding on the facility locations. The framework can be used in international and national domains. It provides a quantitative, fast and flexible way to shortlist the potential locations. Other methods can also be used to further decide on the specific location.}

This study examines the relationship between political data breach risks and cash holdings of firms in China. In response to the risk of data breaches posed by the HFCAA, we believe that Chinese firms may have two competing defend strategies: the reactive defend strategy, which increases their cash reserves as a precautionary measure, and the proactive defend strategy, which utilizes their cash to strengthen their competitive barriers. In the baseline results, we find that when firms in China perceive the industry spillover effect of data breaches, which is from U.S.-listed Chinese firms identified by HFCAA, they will hold less cash, which is consistent with the proactive risk strategy. Our results are robust to alternative measures of cash holdings, parallel trend assumption, PSM-DID and placebo tests. Cross-sectional tests also show that firms with different levels will have various effects. In addition, our further analyses elucidate the channels through which cash holdings are influenced, finding that when faced with data breach risks, Chinese firms are likely to increase their R&D expenditures, which correlates with an increase in the value of their cash holdings.}

Mutation testing tools use mutation operators that modify program elements such as operators, names, and entire statements. Most existing mutation operators focus on imperative and object-oriented language constructs. However, many current projects use meta-programming through code annotations. In a previous work, we have proposed nine mutation operators for code annotations focused on the Java programming language. In this article, we extend our previous work by mapping the operators to the C# language. Moreover, we enlarge the empirical evaluation. In particular, we mine Java and C# projects that make heavy use of annotations to identify annotation-related faults. We analyzed 200 faults and categorized them as “misuse,” when the developer did not appear to know how to use the code annotations properly, and “wrong annotation parsing” when the developer incorrectly parsed annotation code (by using reflection, for example). Our operators mimic 95% of the 200 mined faults. In particular, three operators can mimic 82% of the faults in Java projects and 84% of the faults in C# projects. In addition, we provide an extended and improved repository hosted on GitHub with the 200 code annotation faults we analyzed. We organize the repository according to the type of errors made by the programmers while dealing with code annotations, and to the mutation operator that can mimic the faults. Last but not least, we also provide a mutation engine, based on these operators, which is publicly available and can be incorporated into existing or new mutation tools. The engine works for Java and C#. As implications for practice, our operators can help developers to improve test suites and parsers of annotated code.}

abstract = {A blockchain network is a distributed system established by mutually distrusting participants to operate a blockchain, enabling them to manage critical information such as account balances or asset ownership without a centralised third party. Blockchain network deployment and evaluation have become prevalent due to the emerging blockchain use cases by enterprises, governments, and Internet of Things (IoT) applications, which demand private blockchains rather than participating in public ones. A blockchain network architecture drives deployment and evaluation activities. Nevertheless, practitioners must learn and perform error-prone activities to transform architecture into a blockchain network and evaluate it. Therefore, it is beneficial to automate these activities so that practitioners can focus on the architecture design, a valuable and hard-to-automate activity. The key challenges of such an automation framework are keeping up with the advances in blockchain technologies and the increasing complexity of blockchain network architecture. This paper proposes NVAL, a software framework that implements a novel architecture-driven, community-supported approach to automate blockchain network deployment and evaluation. NVAL accepts blockchain network architecture as input. It supports complex multi-channel blockchain networks, an increasingly prevalent architecture for private blockchain. The framework keeps up with blockchain technologies by leveraging platform-specific automation programmes developed by a practitioner community via runtime composition to handle new networks. We evaluated NVAL with a case study and showed that the framework requires only seven automation programmes to deploy 65 blockchain networks with 12 diverse architectures and generate 295 evaluation datasets. Furthermore, it consumes only 95.5 ms to plan and orchestrate the deployment and evaluation, which is minuscule compared to the total time required for deploying and benchmarking a blockchain network.}

Genetic studies have indicated that a large group of synthetic multivulva (SynMuv) genes, including the Rb ortholog lin-35, antagonizes the activity of the EGF receptor-Ras-MAP kinase pathway during VPC specification. A prevalent view has been that Rb-mediated transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling activities act in the VPCs to antagonize Ras activation through effects on promoters of target genes of the EGF receptor-Ras-MAP kinase pathway that promote vulval fates. Here, we have investigated the cellular focus of lin-35 using conventional genetic mosaic analysis and tissue-specific expression. Our results indicate that lin-35 activity is required in the major hypodermal syncytium and not in the VPCs to inhibit vulval fates. LIN-35 Rb may inhibit vulval fates by regulating a signal from hyp7 to the VPCs or the physiological state of hyp7.}

This paper proposes a TaaS system based on Adaptive Reasoning (AR) and Test Algebra (TA) for Combinatorial Testing (CT). AR performs testing and identifies faulty interactions, and TA eliminates related configurations from testing and there can be carried out concurrently. By combining these two, it is possible to perform large CT that were not possible before. Specifically, we performed experiments with 250 components with 2.83*1087 6-way interactions with about 21.1×1015 configurations, and this may be the largest CT experimentation as 2014. 98.6% of configurations have been eliminated out of total number of configurations.}

Consequently, all code analysis efforts of aspect-oriented code that we are aware of have either built limited analysis tools or were performed manually. Given the significant complexity of building them or manual analysis, a lot of duplication of effort could have been avoided by using a general-purpose tool. To address this, in this paper we present Gasr: a source code analysis tool that reasons over AspectJ source code, which may contain metadata in the form of annotations. GASR provides multiple kinds of analyses that are general enough such that they are reusable, tailorable and can reason over annotations. We demonstrate the use of GASR in two ways: we first automate the recognition of previously identified aspectual source code assumptions. Second, we turn implicit assumptions into explicit assumptions through annotations and automate their verification. In both uses GASR performs detection and verification of aspect assumptions on two well-known case studies that were manually investigated in earlier work. GASR finds already known aspect assumptions and adds instances that had been previously overlooked.}

Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is often associated with a decrease of the concentrations of IGF-I, IGF-II, IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) and an increase of IGFBP-1 and -2. Many investigators have studied the relationship between the GH-IGF-I system and some of the most common characteristics of disease progression, such as decreased CD4 cell counts, weight loss and fat redistribution. Although conditions for restoration of thymic function and lymphopoiesis with GH or IGF-I are still not well defined, many studies led to the development of clinical trials on the therapeutic use of GH, IGF-I and GHRH for the treatment of weight loss or fat redistribution, two problems which persist despite the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy. Monitoring IGF-I concentrations during treatment with GH and GHRH is likely to become an essential component of their therapeutic use. IGF-I levels are the first indicator of treatment efficacy and can be used to monitor compliance. High levels of IGF-I are a warning sign for the increased risk of potential adverse effects, such as acromegalic-like symptoms or malignancy. This could lead to a reduction of the therapeutic dose or the temporary interruption of treatment until IGF levels reach a safe range. IGF-I levels are also likely to increase with other hormones used in HIV patients, such as erythropoietin for the treatment of anemia or anabolic androgens in HIV-infected women.}

Individual sUAS behavior is governed by an onboard state machine, combined with coordination handlers which are configured dynamically within seconds of launch and ultimately determine the sUAS’ behaviors, transition decisions, and interactions with other sUAS, as well as human operators. The just-in-time manner in which missions are configured precludes robust upfront testing of all conceivable combinations of features — both within individual sUAS and across cohorts of collaborating ones. To ensure the absence of common types of configuration failures and to promote safe deployments, we check vital properties of the dynamically generated sUAS specifications and coordination handlers before sUAS are assigned their missions. We evaluate our approach in two ways. First, we perform validation tests to show that the end-to-end configuration process results in correctly executed missions, and second, we apply fault-based mutation testing to show that our safety checks successfully detect incorrect task sequences.}

Then, we proposed a ‘phonetically-informed’ version of this technique, based on full-covariance HMM. This approach aims (1) at modeling explicitly the articulatory timing for each phonetic class, and (2) at exploiting linguistic knowledge to regularize the problem of silent speech conversion. Both techniques were compared on continuous speech, for two French speakers (one male, one female). For modal speech, the HMM-based technique showed a lower spectral distortion (objective evaluation). However, perceptual tests (transcription and XAB discrimination tests) showed a better intelligibility of the GMM-based technique, probably related to its less fluctuant quality. For silent speech, a perceptual identification test revealed a better segmental intelligibility for the HMM-based technique on consonants.}

Automated test generation promises to improve the effectiveness of software testing and to reduce the involved manual effort. While automated test generation has been successfully applied for code-level API testing, it has not found widespread adoption in practice for testing of graphical user interfaces. Tools for test generation do not support GUI testing out-of-the-box but require dedicated extensions.
Objective
This paper explores the applicability of automated test generation for testing GUIs of industry applications. We propose a test adapter approach to bridge the gap between automated test generation tools and industry applications.
Method
A multiple case study was conducted in which automated test generation with test adapters has been applied at the unit, integration, and system test level in three industry projects from two different companies.
Results
Automated test generation via test adapters could be applied at all test levels. It has led to an increase of coverage as well as the detection of new defects that were not found by preceding testing activities in the projects. While test adapters can easily be implemented at the unit test level, their complexity and the corresponding effort for providing adapter implementations rises at higher test levels.
Conclusion
Test adapters can be used for applying automated test generation for testing GUIs of industry applications. They bridge the gap between automated test generation tools and industry applications. The development of test adapters requires no tool-specific knowledge and can be performed by members of the development team.}

abstract = {A common type of study used by researchers to map out the landscape of a research topic is known as mapping study. Such a study typically begins with an exploratory search on the possible ideas of the research topic, which is often done in an unsystematic manner. Hence, the activity of formulating research questions in mapping studies is ill-defined, rendering it difficult for researchers who are new to the topic. There is a need to guide them kicking off a mapping study of an unfamiliar domain. This paper proposes a 5W+1H pattern to help investigators systematically examine a generic set of dimensions in a mapping study toward the formulation of research questions before identifying, reading, and analyzing sufficient articles of the topic. We have validated the feasibility of our proposal by conducting a case study of a mapping study on cloud software testing, that is, software testing for and on cloud computing platforms. The case study reveals that the 5W+1H pattern can lead investigators to define a set of systematic, generic, and complementary research questions, enabling them to kick off and expedite the mapping study process in a well-defined manner. We also share our experiences and lessons learned from our case study on the use of the 5W+1H pattern in mapping studies.}

The mechanisms and specificities of primary neurogenesis, which occurs from the recruitment of progenitors from the earliest proneural clusters by lateral inhibition, are first described. Next, during secondary neurogenesis, neuronal and glial cell diversities are generated, in particular with the establishment of neuromodulatory circuits. Finally, and in contrast to mammals, neurogenesis in zebrafish does not stall with nervous system maturation but is constitutively maintained to account for the continuous growth and regenerating properties of the adult brain. Recent studies identified the localization, identities, and properties of adult progenitor cells. Interestingly, the same proneural and neurogenic pathways seem to be reiterated at these late stages.}

The challenges posed by the architecting of System of Systems (SoS) has motivated a significant number of research efforts in the area. However, literature is lacking when it comes to the interplay between the disciplines involved in the architecting process, a key factor in addressing these challenges.
Objective:
This paper aims to contribute to this line of research by confirming and extending previously characterized architecting harmonization practices from Systems and Software Engineering, adopted in an ultra-large-scale SoS.
Methods:
We conducted a confirmatory case study on the Square-Kilometre Array (SKA) project to evaluate and extend the findings of our exploratory case on the LOFAR/LOFAR2.0 radio-telescope projects. In doing so, a pre-study was conducted to map the findings of the previous study with respect to the SKA context. A survey was then designed, through which the views of 46 SKA engineers were collected and analyzed.
Results:
The study confirmed in various degrees the four practices identified in the exploratory case, and provided further insights about them: (1) the friction between disciplines caused by long-term system requirements, and how they can be ameliorated through intermediate, short-term requirements; (2) the way design choices with a cross-cutting impact on multiple agile teams have an indirect impact on the system architecture; (3) how these design choices are often caused by the criteria that guided early system decomposition; (4) the seemingly recurrent issue with the lack of details about the dynamic elements of the interfaces; and (5) the use of machine-readable interface specifications for aligning hardware/software development processes.
Conclusions:
The findings of this study and its predecessor support the importance of a cross-disciplinary view in the Software Engineering research agenda in SoS as a whole, not to mention their value as a convergence point for research on SoS architecting from the Systems and Software Engineering standpoints.}

One of the most important differentiators between embedded and general-purpose computing is that embedded systems typically run one single application or set of applications exclusively. This affects many aspects of computing, including code development. Although in most respects, embedded application development resembles general code development, special languages can play a role when the application under development will be embedded in a product because of different lifetime, user community, and underlying hardware considerations. Similarly, the process of making code perform can well change. Techniques that might be unacceptable in the general-purpose world can be almost essential in the embedded world, in which a product may be of no use if it cannot meet a speed or power requirement. Embedded computing is unique in that the hardware too is built to run a single application, and thus methodologies for customization become relevant. This topic is part of the larger area of hardware/software codesign. Embedded designers face issues at the hardware/software boundary that are closed to designers of general-purpose systems. Customized hardware presents an opportunity to vastly speed up individual applications. This opportunity has led to a lively research area and the foundation of more than a few startup companies.}

abstract = {Context
Quality requirements (QRs) describe the desired quality of software, and they play an important role in the success of software projects. In agile software development (ASD), QRs are often ill-defined and not well addressed due to the focus on quickly delivering functionality. Rapid software development (RSD) approaches (e.g., continuous delivery and continuous deployment), which shorten delivery times, are more prone to neglect QRs. Despite the significance of QRs in both ASD and RSD, there is limited synthesized knowledge on their management in those approaches.
Objective
This study aims to synthesize state-of-the-art knowledge about QR management in ASD and RSD, focusing on three aspects: bibliometric, strategies, and challenges.
Research method
Using a systematic mapping study with a snowballing search strategy, we identified and structured the literature on QR management in ASD and RSD.
Results
We found 156 primary studies: 106 are empirical studies, 16 are experience reports, and 34 are theoretical studies. Security and performance were the most commonly reported QR types. We identified various QR management strategies: 74 practices, 43 methods, 13 models, 12 frameworks, 11 advices, 10 tools, and 7 guidelines. Additionally, we identified 18 categories and 4 non-recurring challenges of managing QRs. The limited ability of ASD to handle QRs, time constraints due to short iteration cycles, limitations regarding the testing of QRs and neglect of QRs were the top categories of challenges.
Conclusion
Management of QRs is significant in ASD and is becoming important in RSD. This study identified research gaps, such as the need for more tools and guidelines, lightweight QR management strategies that fit short iteration cycles, investigations of the link between QRs challenges and technical debt, and extension of empirical validation of existing strategies to a wider context. It also synthesizes QR management strategies and challenges, which may be useful for practitioners.}

Because the resulting code is generated just right and not changed afterward, MetaOCaml guarantees that the generated code is well-typed. We further demonstrate that various abstraction parameters (aspects) can be made orthogonal and compositional, even in the presence of name-generation for temporaries, and “interleaving” of aspects. We also show how to encode some domain-specific knowledge so that “clearly wrong” compositions can be rejected at or before generation time, rather than during the compilation or running of the generated code.}

abstract = {Context
Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE) is an emerging discipline that focuses on the application of search-based optimization techniques to software engineering problems. Software Product Lines (SPLs) are families of related software systems whose members are distinguished by the set of features each one provides. SPL development practices have proven benefits such as improved software reuse, better customization, and faster time to market. A typical SPL usually involves a large number of systems and features, a fact that makes them attractive for the application of SBSE techniques which are able to tackle problems that involve large search spaces.
Objective
The main objective of our work is to identify the quantity and the type of research on the application of SBSE techniques to SPL problems. More concretely, the SBSE techniques that have been used and at what stage of the SPL life cycle, the type of case studies employed and their empirical analysis, and the fora where the research has been published.
Method
A systematic mapping study was conducted with five research questions and assessed 77 publications from 2001, when the term SBSE was coined, until 2014.
Results
The most common application of SBSE techniques found was testing followed by product configuration, with genetic algorithms and multi-objective evolutionary algorithms being the two most commonly used techniques. Our study identified the need to improve the robustness of the empirical evaluation of existing research, a lack of extensive and robust tool support, and multiple avenues worthy of further investigation.
Conclusions
Our study attested the great synergy existing between both fields, corroborated the increasing and ongoing interest in research on the subject, and revealed challenging open research questions.}

We found that each antibody inhibited tumor growth and that the combination of the two antibodies was more effective than either alone. Treatment with anti-human DLL4 inhibited the expression of Notch target genes and reduced proliferation of tumor cells. Furthermore, we found that specifically inhibiting human DLL4 in the tumor, either alone or in combination with the chemotherapeutic agent irinotecan, reduced cancer stem cell frequency, as shown by flow cytometric and in vivo tumorigenicity studies.}

The two conceptual case studies are composites of real experiences of various service providers. The combination of these two conceptual studies with a real-world example demonstrates the full impact of IP in both business and technical aspects. The conceptual case studies present scenarios for both Greenfield and incumbent service providers. The conceptual case studies and the Meta Telecom experience have drawn a picture of the business and technical aspects associated with IP-based service creation. There are common success factors in all three examples that include upper-management support and vision to use IP technology to transform a company, the redefinition of business–engineering processes for company-wide IP-based service development and deployment, an emphasis on OSS architecture as the base for service creation, and, finally, the positive interaction between customers, service providers, and vendors.}

abstract = {Summary
Background & aims
Nutrition is the major environmental factor that influences the risk of developing pathologies, such as obesity. Although a number of recent reviews pinpoint a protective effects of milk on body weight and obesity related co-morbidities, an inaccurate estimate of milk might contribute to hamper its beneficial effects on health outcomes. Seven-day food records provide prospective food intake data, reducing recall bias and providing extra details about specific food items. Milk intake stimulates the somatotropic axis at multiple levels by increasing both growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) secretion. On the other hand, obesity is associated with reduced spontaneous and stimulated GH secretion and basal IGF-1 levels. Aim of this study was to evaluate the milk consumption by using the 7-days food record in obese individuals and to investigate the association between milk intake and GH secretory status in these subjects.
Methods
Cross-sectional observational study carried out on 281 adult individuals (200 women and 81 men, aged 18–74 years) with moderate-severe obesity (BMI 35.2–69.4 kg/m2). Baseline milk intake data were collected using a 7 day food record. Anthropometric measurements and biochemical profile were determined. The GH/IGF-1 axis was evaluated by peak GH response after GHRH + ARGININE and IGF-1 standard deviation score (SDS).
Results
The majority of individuals (72.2%) reported consuming milk; 250 mL low-fat milk was the most frequently serving of milk consumed, while no subjects reported to consume whole milk. Milk consumers vs no milk consumers presented the better anthropometric measurements and metabolic profile. At the bivariate proportional odds ratio model, after adjusting for BMI, age and gender, milk consumption was associated the better GH status (OR = 0.60; p < 0.001). Among milk consumers, subjects consuming 250 mL reduced-fat milk vs 250 mL low-fat milk presented the better anthropometric measurements and metabolic profile. At the bivariate proportional odds ratio model, after adjusting for BMI, age and gender, the consume of 250 mL reduced-fat milk was associated better GH status (OR = 0.54; p = 0.003).
Conclusions
A novel positive association between milk consumption, GH status, and metabolic profile in obese individuals was evidenced. Regardless of the pathogenetic mechanisms, this novel association might be relevant in a context where commonly obese individuals skip breakfast, and suggests the need of a growing cooperation between Nutritionists and Endocrinologists in the management of the obese patients.}

abstract = {Context
Software product lines (SPLs) and Agile are approaches that share similar objectives. The main difference is the way in which these objectives are met. Typically evidence on what activities of Agile and SPL can be combined and how they can be integrated stems from different research methods performed separately. The generalizability of this evidence is low, as the research topic is still relatively new and previous studies have been conducted using only one research method.
Objective
This study aims to increase understanding of Agile SPL and improve the generalizability of the identified evidence through the use of a multi-method approach.
Method
Our multi-method research combines three complementary methods (Mapping Study, Case Study and Expert Opinion) to consolidate the evidence.
Results
This combination results in 23 findings that provide evidence on how Agile and SPL could be combined.
Conclusion
Although multi-method research is time consuming and requires a high degree of effort to plan, design, and perform, it helps to increase the understanding on Agile SPL and leads to more generalizable evidence. The findings confirm a synergy between Agile and SPL and serve to improve the body of evidence in Agile SPL. When researchers and practitioners develop new Agile SPL approaches, it will be important to consider these synergies.}

abstract = {In this paper we comprehensively survey the concept and strategies for building a resilient and integrated cyber–physical system (CPS). Here resilience refers to a 3S-oriented design, that is, stability, security, and systematicness: Stability means the CPS can achieve a stable sensing-actuation close-loop control even though the inputs (sensing data) have noise or attacks; Security means that the system can overcome the cyber–physical interaction attacks; and Systematicness means that the system has a seamless integration of sensors and actuators. We will also explain the CPS modeling issues since they serve as the basics of 3S design. We will use two detailed examples from our achieved projects to explain how to achieve arobust, systematic CPS design: Case study 1 is on the design of a rehabilitation system with cyber (sensors) and physical (robots) integration. Case Study 2 is on the implantable medical device design. It illustrates the nature of CPS security principle. The dominant feature of this survey is that it has both principle discussions and practical cyber–physical coupling design.}

abstract = {Context
Continuous experimentation guides development activities based on data collected on a subset of online users on a new experimental version of the software. It includes practices such as canary releases, gradual rollouts, dark launches, or A/B testing.
Objective
Unfortunately, our knowledge of continuous experimentation is currently primarily based on well-known and outspoken industrial leaders. To assess the actual state of practice in continuous experimentation, we conducted a mixed-method empirical study.
Method
In our empirical study consisting of four steps, we interviewed 31 developers or release engineers, and performed a survey that attracted 187 complete responses. We analyzed the resulting data using statistical analysis and open coding.
Results
Our results lead to several conclusions: (1) from a software architecture perspective, continuous experimentation is especially enabled by architectures that foster independently deployable services, such as microservices-based architectures; (2) from a developer perspective, experiments require extensive monitoring and analytics to discover runtime problems, consequently leading to developer on call policies and influencing the role and skill sets required by developers; and (3) from a process perspective, many organizations conduct experiments based on intuition rather than clear guidelines and robust statistics.
Conclusion
Our findings show that more principled and structured approaches for release decision making are needed, striving for highly automated, systematic, and data- and hypothesis-driven deployment and experimentation.}

A microservice architecture is composed of a set of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms. Many aspects on architecting with microservices are still unexplored and existing research is still far from being crispy clear.
Objective
We aim at identifying, classifying, and evaluating the state of the art on architecting with microservices from the following perspectives: publication trends, focus of research, and potential for industrial adoption.
Method
We apply the systematic mapping methodology. We rigorously selected 103 primary studies and we defined and applied a classification framework to them for extracting key information for subsequent analysis. We synthesized the obtained data and produced a clear overview of the state of the art.
Results
This work contributes with (i) a classification framework for research studies on architecting with microservices, (ii) a systematic map of current research of the field, (iii) an evaluation of the potential for industrial adoption of research results, and (iv) a discussion of emerging findings and implications for future research.
Conclusion
This study provides a solid, rigorous, and replicable picture of the state of the art on architecting with microservices. Its results can benefit both researchers and practitioners of the field.}

We conducted a systematic mapping study and classified the continuous deployment literature. The benefits and challenges related to continuous deployment were also analysed. RESULTS: The systematic mapping study includes 50 primary studies published between 2001 and 2014. An in-depth analysis of the primary studies revealed ten recurrent themes that characterize continuous deployment and provide researchers with directions for future work. In addition, a set of benefits and challenges of which practitioners may take advantage were identified. CONCLUSION: Overall, although the topic area is very promising, it is still in its infancy, thus offering a plethora of new opportunities for both researchers and software intensive companies.}

The original semi-structured requirements, locally known as business rules, were written as message specifications in a non-standardized and error-prone format using MS Word. To remedy the resulting software failures and faults, we first formalized the requirements by designing an W3C XML Schema for the precise definition of the requirements structure. The schema allows a highly structured representation of the essential information in eXtensible Markup Language (XML). Second, to offer the requirements engineers the ability to edit the XML documents in a friendly way while preserving their information structure, we developed a custom editor called XLEdit. Third, by developing a converter from MS Word to the target XML format, we helped the requirements engineers to migrate the existing business rules. Fourth, we developed translators from the structured requirements to schema languages, which enabled automated generation of message-validation code. The increase in customer satisfaction and clearinghouse-service efficiency are primary gains from the investment in the technology for structured requirements editing and validation.}

abstract = {At the core of Model-Based Design, computational models have caused an autocatalytic trend to use computation in design by unlocking the potential of model transformations. Precisely specifying a computational transformation requires well-defined semantics of the source and target representations. In this regard, continuous-time behavior is an essential aspect of time-based block diagrams that is typically approximated by numerical integration. The corresponding theory, however, is mostly concerned with local error and the mathematical semantics of long time behavior fails to be sufficiently precise from a computational perspective. In this work, first a computational semantics is developed based on a multi-stage variablestep solver. Next, the computational semantics of the discrete and continuous parts of hybrid systems and their interaction are formalized in a unifying framework. The framework exploits a successful functional approach to defining discrete-time and discrete-event behavior established in other work. Unification is then achieved by developing a computational representation of the continuous-time behavior as pure functions on streams.}

The paper constructs an exploratory conceptual model of technology utilization and expenditures in Japan, induced from prior literature. Ten dependent ICT utilization and expenditure factors are posited to be related to 12 independent demographic, economic, infrastructure, education, innovation and openness factors. The relationship of the independent to dependent factors is moderated by analysis of spatial patterns of technology utilization to examine proximities and reduce spatial bias. Based on the model, a multivariate analysis identifies correlates of the nation׳s digital divide, including patents registered by Japanese citizens, newspaper circulation, students and pupils per capita, household expenditures on education, rural/urban status, and Japan׳s aged population structure which has wide generational gaps. Spatial clusters and outliers of ICTs in prefectures are analyzed, with attention to their policy impacts. Findings suggest modifications to the conceptual model. Implications of findings for the country׳s official national technology planning policies are considered and recommendations made to expand them.}

abstract = {Static code analysis tools such as FindBugs and SonarQube are widely used on open-source and industrial projects to detect a variety of issues that may negatively affect the quality of software. Despite these tools’ popularity and high level of automation, several empirical studies report that developers normally fix only a small fraction (typically, less than 10% (Marcilio et al., 2019) of the reported issues—so-called “warnings”. If these analysis tools could also automatically provide suggestions on how to fix the issues that trigger some of the warnings, their feedback would become more actionable and more directly useful to developers. In this work, we investigate whether it is feasible to automatically generate fix suggestions for common warnings issued by static code analysis tools, and to what extent developers are willing to accept such suggestions into the codebases they are maintaining. To this end, we implemented SpongeBugs, a Java program transformation technique that fixes 11 distinct rules checked by two well-known static code analysis tools (SonarQube and SpotBugs). Fix suggestions are generated automatically based on templates, which are instantiated in a way that removes the source of the warnings; templates for some rules are even capable of producing multi-line patches. Based on the suggestions provided by SpongeBugs, we submitted 38 pull requests, including 946 fixes generated automatically by our technique for various open-source Java projects, including Eclipse UI – a core component of the Eclipse IDE – and both SonarQube and SpotBugs. Project maintainers accepted 87% of our fix suggestions (97% of them without any modifications). We further evaluated the applicability of our technique on software written by students and on a curated collection of bugs. All results indicate that our approach to generating fix suggestions is feasible, flexible, and can help increase the applicability of static code analysis tools.}

In many cases, the cyber component controls the physical side using sensors and actuators that observe the physical system and actuate the controls. Such systems present the biggest challenges as well as the biggest opportunities in several large industries, including electronics, energy, automotive, defense and aerospace, telecommunications, instrumentation, industrial automation. Engineers today do successfully design cyber-physical systems in a variety of industries. Unfortunately, the development of systems is costly, and development schedules are difficult to stick to. The complexity of cyber-physical systems, and particularly the increased performance that is offered from interconnecting what in the past have been separate systems, increases the design and verification challenges. As the complexity of these systems increases, our inability to rigorously model the interactions between the physical and the cyber sides creates serious vulnerabilities. Systems become unsafe, with disastrous inexplicable failures that could not have been predicted. Distributed control of multi-scale complex systems is largely an unsolved problem. A common view that is emerging in research programs in Europe and the US is “enabling contract-based design (CBD),” which formulates a broad and aggressive scope to address urgent needs in the systems industry. We present a design methodology and a few examples in controller design whereby contract-based design can be merged with platform-based design to formulate the design process as a meet-in-the-middle approach, where design requirements are implemented in a subsequent refinement process using as much as possible elements from a library of available components. Contracts are formalizations of the conditions for correctness of element integration (horizontal contracts), for lower level of abstraction to be consistent with the higher ones, and for abstractions of available components to be faithful representations of the actual parts (vertical contracts).}

This chapter explains the semiconductor intellectual property (SIP) overview, business environment, sourcing products, evaluating business models, product enablers, licensing products, and the provider and buyer perspectives. SIP has existed since the advent of the semiconductor industry. SIP business practices include elements similar to those found in the traditional semiconductor or application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), electronic design automation (EDA), and design services markets. Outsourcing is unlikely if the SIP product is seen by the potential buyer as a core competency or a key differentiator in its product, or if its use requires third-party access to the buyer's patents or trade secrets. SIP License Agreements may require a significant effort depending upon the business objectives of the parties, the intended use of the SIP Product, the nature of the SIP product, and the risks associated with using the SIP product in the end application. The scope of license, warranty, indemnity, and limitation of liability provisions usually consume the majority of the effort in negotiating an SIP License Agreement. However, IC developers are finding more low-cost solutions at their fingertips, and the semiconductor supply chain has become increasingly stratified.}

abstract = {Context
Reusing a design pattern is not always in the favor of developers. Thus, the code starts smelling. The presence of “Code Smells” leads to more difficulties for the developers. This racket of code smells is sometimes called Anti-Patterns.
Objective
The paper aimed at a systematic literature review of refactoring with respect to code smells. However the review of refactoring is done in general and the identification of code smells and anti-patterns is performed in depth.
Method
A systematic literature survey has been performed on 238 research items that includes articles from leading Conferences, Workshops and premier journals, theses of researchers and book chapters.
Results
Several data sets and tools for performing refactoring have been revealed under the specified research questions.
Conclusion
The work done in the paper is an addition to prior systematic literature surveys. With the study of paper the attentiveness of readers about code smells and anti-patterns will be enhanced.}

abstract = {The Aspergillus nidulans gene (acvA) encoding the first catalytic steps of penicillin biosynthesis that result in the formation of delta-(L-alpha-aminoadipyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine (ACV), has been positively identified by matching a 15-amino acid segment of sequence obtained from an internal CNBr fragment of the purified amino-terminally blocked protein with that predicted from the DNA sequence. acvA is transcribed in the opposite orientation to ipnA (encoding isopenicillin N synthetase), with an intergenic region of 872 nucleotides. The gene has been completely sequenced at the nucleotide level and found to encode a protein of 3,770 amino acids (molecular mass, 422,486 Da). Both fast protein liquid chromatography and native gel estimates of molecular mass are consistent with this predicted molecular weight. The enzyme was identified as a glycoprotein by means of affinity blotting with concanavalin A. No evidence for the presence of introns within the acvA gene has been found. The derived amino acid sequence of ACV synthetase (ACVS) contains three homologous regions of about 585 residues, each of which displays areas of similarity with (i) adenylate-forming enzymes such as parsley 4-coumarate-CoA ligase and firefly luciferase and (ii) several multienzyme peptide synthetases, including bacterial gramicidin S synthetase 1 and tyrocidine synthetase 1. Despite these similarities, conserved cysteine residues found in the latter synthetases and thought to be essential for the thiotemplate mechanism of peptide biosynthesis have not been detected in the ACVS sequence. These observations, together with the occurrence of putative 4'-phosphopantetheine-attachment sites and a putative thioesterase site, are discussed with reference to the reaction sequence leading to production of the ACV tripeptide. We speculate that each of the homologous regions corresponds to a functional domain that recognizes one of the three substrate amino acids.}

The measures we use are basic counts reflecting program size and structure and metrics proposed by McCabe and Halstead. The effect of program size has a major influence on these metrics, and we present a suitable method of adjusting the metrics for size. In modeling faults or repair effort as a function of one variable, a number of measures individually explain approximately one-quarter of the variation observed in the fault data. No one measure does significantly better than size in explaining the variation in faults found across software units, and thus multiple variable models are necessary to find metrics of importance in addition to program size. The “best” multivariate model explains approximately one-half the variation in the fault data. The metrics included in this model (in addition to size) are: the ratio of block comments to total lines of code, the number of decisions per function, and the relative vocabulary of program variables and operators. These metrics have potential for future use in the quality control of software.}

abstract = {Publisher Summary
The chapter presents the overview of the present status of software science. Software science is an intellectually exciting discipline currently undergoing rapid development. Software science can be treated as a proper basis or foundation for the field of software engineering, but not as synonymous with it. This is not unlike other branches, in that the engineering usually preceded and indeed stimulated the development of the underlying science. It is interesting to note, however, that it is only after the development of thermodynamics for power engineering, electrodynamics for electrical engineering, or statics, dynamics, and strength-of-materials for mechanical engineering that those branches could be considered quasi complete, highly competent, and dependable engineering disciplines. Such a goal for software engineering clearly motivates much of the work in software science. Despite the fact that there are no theorems, and perhaps never can be any, in the field of software science, one basic attribute shared by the equations in this field has become quite noticeable. This is the total and complete lack of arbitrary constants or unknown coefficients among the basic equations. It cannot yet be predicted what impact this discipline may be expected to have on the field of software engineering, or of computer programming in general in the future, but perhaps its greatest impact may result from one conclusion that seems inescapable. This conclusion is that natural laws govern language and the mental activity of using it far more strictly than previously recognized.}

Presently, more and more software-based products and services are available in many different variants to choose from. However, this brings about challenges for the software quality assurance processes. Since only few of all possible variants can be tested at the developer's site, several questions arise. How shall the variability be described in order to make sure that all features are being tested? Is it better to test selected variants on a concrete level, or shall the whole software product line be tested abstractly? What is the quality of a test suite for a product line, anyway? If it is impossible to test all possible variants, which products should be selected for testing? Given a certain product, which test cases are appropriate for it, and given a test case, which products can be tested with it? We address these questions from an empirical software engineering point of view. We sketch modeling formalisms for software product lines. Then, we compare domain-centered and application-centered approaches to software product line testing. We define mutation operators for assessing software product line test suites. Subsequently, we analyze methods for selecting product variants on the basis of a given test suite. Finally, we show how model checking can be used to determine whether a certain test case is applicable for a certain product variant. For all our methods we describe supporting tools and algorithms. Currently, we are integrating these in an integrated tool suite supporting several aspects of model-based testing for software product lines.}

Also push-based solutions from the distributed systems are being adopted on the web for ajax applications. The field is, however, characterized by the lack of a coherent and precisely described set of architectural concepts. As a consequence, it is rather difficult to understand, assess, and compare the existing approaches. We have studied and experimented with several ajax frameworks trying to understand their architectural properties. In this paper, we summarize four of these frameworks and examine their properties and introduce the spiar architectural style which captures the essence of ajax applications. We describe the guiding software engineering principles and the constraints chosen to induce the desired properties. The style emphasizes user interface component development, intermediary delta-communication between client/server components, and push-based event notification of state changes through the components, to improve a number of properties such as user interactivity, user-perceived latency, data coherence, and ease of development. In addition, we use the concepts and principles to discuss various open issues in ajax frameworks and application development.}

Hundreds of configuration options, features, or plugins can be combined, each potentially with distinct functionality and effects on execution time, security, energy consumption, etc. Due to the combinatorial explosion and the cost of executing software, it is quickly impossible to exhaustively explore the whole configuration space. Hence, numerous works have investigated the idea of learning it from a small sample of configurations’ measurements. The pattern “sampling, measuring, learning” has emerged in the literature, with several practical interests for both software developers and end-users of configurable systems. In this systematic literature review, we report on the different application objectives (e.g., performance prediction, configuration optimization, constraint mining), use-cases, targeted software systems, and application domains. We review the various strategies employed to gather a representative and cost-effective sample. We describe automated software techniques used to measure functional and non-functional properties of configurations. We classify machine learning algorithms and how they relate to the pursued application. Finally, we also describe how researchers evaluate the quality of the learning process. The findings from this systematic review show that the potential application objective is important; there are a vast number of case studies reported in the literature related to particular domains or software systems. Yet, the huge variant space of configurable systems is still challenging and calls to further investigate the synergies between artificial intelligence and software engineering.}

This chapter establishes a series of related principles that both support the architectural analysis and serve as high-level scoping and requirements for the value system. The chapter attempts to build a new kind of process framework for large scale IT management in the enterprise. The concept of an overall IT value chain and the four major, long-lived value streams of large-scale enterprise information technology (application services, infrastructure services, IT assets, and IT technology products) are discussed in the chapter. The shorter IT processes are also elaborated. The process architecture is represented as a set of larger-grained lifecycles that are acted upon by a series of well- understood IT processes with clear beginnings and endings. Value streams and processes are the key means by which value is delivered in IT, as in any business. A relentless attention to reducing unnecessary activity along these activity sequences is essential to increasing value. Synchronization points, dependencies, and critical paths would all be of interest, and constitute the foundation of IT value stream analysis. Much in IT is related to nonprocess concepts: quality concepts such as capacity and availability, or the actual functional areas that own the various lifecycles and processes. An overall systems architecture is presented for the business of IT, discussing fundamentals of enterprise application architecture and the major classes of systems encountered in IT management. Summary matrices are introduced in this discussion as a means of showing how the various architectural elements may interact.}

This chapter presents an analysis of the principal engineering and economic issues that have emerged as telephone companies consider rewiring the nation's residences with fiber optics. Assuming significant future reductions in component costs, running fiber optic to the home is likely to remain more expensive than copper, where current loop plant costs are roughly $920 per subscriber. To realize the introduction of a fiber Integrated Broadband Networks (IBN), it must be justified on the basis of additional revenue producing services, such as the delivery of entertainment video. Fiber optic network capable of providing both voice and video services to the home can be constructed for $1800 to $2500 per home passed. Future developments in microelectronics, lasers, photodetectors, and powering architectures will greatly influence the economics of network evolution.}

Beginning more as a frolic among computer enthusiasts, VoIP has set off a feeding frenzy in both the industrial and scientific communities and has the potential to radically change telephone communications. In this article, we survey all these aspects that have the greatest impact on the quality of voice communications over IP networks. The survey begins with the merits and demerits of VoIP, followed by the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements that voice imposes and a description of test methods for the assessment of speech quality. We then proceed with a delineation of the issues related to the conversion of analog voice to packets, namely we spell out the details of the most well-known voice codecs, while light is also thrown on voice activity detection and voice packetization. Header compression schemes receive intense scrutiny as well. We also provide an overview of the signaling protocols that are tailored to the needs of VoIP, and we continue with the comparison of the call admission schemes that are geared towards the QoS constraints of VoIP. The pivotal issue of security is then discussed, pointing out potential threats as well as approaches for tackling them. Finally, the survey concludes with a discussion on the feasibility of providing VoIP over challenging satellite links.}

Active disks process higher priority disk accesses for OnLine Transaction Processing - OLTP, while processing data mining requests as no cost freeblock accesses.

Some of the rendering technologies such as DD/EDDL and FDT are discussed in more detail for the instrumentation engineers to get more familiar with these technologies and hence help them to choose the same selectively, considering the needs of the plants. The plant asset management systems and the modeling and underlying benefits of such systems are also discussed to create awareness on the possibilities of asset management in a plant context extending the limits from instrumentation and control to assets such as pumps, electrical machinery, and rotating equipment.}

The case study presented in this chapter concentrates on a two-phase discussion of model-driven modernization. To deal with the myriad of technological combinations found in modernization roadmaps, model-driven approaches, and tools offer the requisite abstraction level to build up mature and flexible modernization solutions. This chapter presents the initial collaboration between AtlanMod and Sodifrance, which led to a model-driven legacy modernization approach. The use of model-driven technologies on major migration projects has proven the benefit of this approach. Based on metamodeling standards, the tools used to extract the knowledge from existing applications, to transform the knowledge into new paradigms and architecture, and to regenerate the application according to specific technical platforms and patterns are more flexible and reusable. The new MoDisco platform brings all these benefits into an open extensible framework containing model-driven, reverse-engineering tools and components. The current process and tools used by Sodifrance on its modernization projects are elaborated in the discussion. An illustration drawn from a real migration project carried out for Amadeus Hospitality is also included. A new Eclipse initiative capitalizing on this experience to deliver a model-driven platform for the development of legacy modernization tools is presented.}

The interviews were analyzed qualitatively, and quantification of the analysis results is presented. We first create an overview of software engineering in the heavy-duty mobile machinery industry. We then identify problem areas affecting software development and discuss some of the possible solutions found in literature. Our findings indicate that the major problem areas faced in the industry that require more research are its digital transformation, autonomous machine functional safety, low availability of workforce for developing software for robotic mobile machines and the lack of established software standards.}

abstract = {Model-driven engineering (MDE) is an iterative and incremental software development process. Supporting the analysis and the verification of software systems developed following the MDE paradigm requires to adopt incrementality when carrying out these crucial tasks in a more optimized way. Communicating state machines are one of the various formalisms used in MDE tools to model and describe the behavior of distributed, concurrent, and real-time reactive systems (e.g., automotive and avionics systems). Modeling the overall behavior of such systems is carried out in a modular way and on different levels of abstraction (i.e., it starts with modeling the behavior of the individual objects in the system first then modeling the interaction between these objects). Similarly, analyzing and verifying the correctness of the developed models to ensure their quality and their integrity is performed on two main levels. The intralevel is used to analyze the correctness of the individual models in isolation of the others, while the interlevel is used to analyze the overall interoperability of those that are communicating with each other. One way to facilitate the analysis of the overall behavior of a system of communicating state machines is to build the global state space (also known as the global reachability tree) of the system. This process is very expensive and in some cases it may suffer from the state explosion problem. Symbolic execution is a technique that can be used to construct an abstract and a bounded version of the system global state space that is known as a symbolic execution tree (SET), yet the size of the generated trees can be very large especially with big and complex systems that are composed of multiple objects. As the system evolves, one way to avoid regenerating the entire SET and repeating any SET-based analyses that have been already conducted is to utilize the previous SET and its analysis results in optimizing the process of generating the SET of the system after the change. In this chapter, we propose two optimization techniques to direct the successive runs of the symbolic execution technique toward the impacted parts of an evolving state machine model using memoization (MSE) and dependency analysis (DSE), respectively. The evaluation results of both techniques showed significant reduction in some cases compared with the standard symbolic execution technique.}

These tools and their artifacts need to be managed in a coherent way all along the design process and need to address timing constraints and execution semantic in a holistic way during the system’s modeling, verification, and implementation phases. However, modeling languages used by these tools do not always share a common semantic. This can introduce a dangerous gap between what designers want to express, what is verified and the behavior of the final executable code. In order to address this problem, we propose a new toolchain, called Hippo, that integrates tools for design, verification and execution built around a common formalism. Our approach is based on an extension of the Fiacre specification language with runtime features, such as asynchronous function calls and synchronization with events. We formally define the behavior of these additions and describe a compiler to generate both an executable code and a verifiable model from the same high-level specification. The execution of the resulting code is supported by a dedicated execution engine that guarantees real-time behavior and that reduces the semantic gap between high-level models and executable code. We illustrate our approach with a non-trivial use case: the autonomous navigation of a Segway RMP440 robotic platform. We describe how we derive a Hippo model from an initial specification of the system based on the robotics programming framework . We also show how to use the Hippo runtime to control this robot, and how to use formal verification in order to check critical properties on this system.}

Despite the importance of software maintenance, it has acquired the reputation of being a second-class area in which to work. The paper defines in more detail the term software maintenance, and then addresses the issues of maintaining existing code, and producing maintainable systems, stressing the role of reengineering. Three projects that focus on software maintenance are then summarized. All three aim to provide automated assistance to the software maintainer, but in contrasting ways. The ReForm project is based on a formal method to extract specifications from code using transformations. MACS and REDO are both transnational European projects funded by the Esprit collaborative programme of research; the former uses expert system technology to assist the maintainer, while REDO aims to provide a set of integratable tools within a single environment, to support the reverse engineering process.}

abstract = {The adoption of agile approaches has put an increased emphasis on testing, resulting in extensive test suites. These suites include a large number of tests, in which developers embed knowledge about meaningful input data and expected properties as oracles. This article surveys works that exploit this knowledge to enhance manually written tests with respect to an engineering goal (e.g., improve coverage or refine fault localization). While these works rely on various techniques and address various goals, we believe they form an emerging and coherent field of research, which we coin “test amplification”. We devised a first set of papers from DBLP, searching for all papers containing “test” and “amplification” in their title. We reviewed the 70 papers in this set and selected the 4 papers that fit the definition of test amplification. We use them as the seeds for our snowballing study, and systematically followed the citation graph. This study is the first that draws a comprehensive picture of the different engineering goals proposed in the literature for test amplification. We believe that this survey will help researchers and practitioners entering this new field to understand more quickly and more deeply the intuitions, concepts and techniques used for test amplification.}

abstract = {Customizing software to perfectly fit individual needs is becoming increasingly important in information systems engineering. Users want to be able to customize software behavior through reference to terms familiar to their diverse needs and experience. We present a requirements-driven approach to behavioral customization of software systems. Goal models are constructed to represent alternative behaviors that users can exhibit to achieve their goals. Customization information is then added to restrict the space of possibilities to those that fit specific users, contexts, or situations. Meanwhile, elements of the goal models are mapped to units of source code. This way, customization preferences posed at the requirements level are directly translated into system customizations. Our approach, which we apply to an on-line shopping cart system and an automated teller machine simulator, does not assume adoption of a particular development methodology, platform, or variability implementation technique and keeps the reasoning computation overhead from interfering with the execution of the configured application.}

Furthermore, to complete the framework of a parallel input analysis, a parallel scanner can also combined with the parser. To prove the practicality of a parallel lexing and parsing approach, we report the results of the adaptation of JSON and Lua to a form fit for parallel parsing (i.e. an operator-precedence grammar) through simple grammar changes and scanning transformations. The approach is validated with performance figures from both high performance and embedded multicore platforms, obtained analyzing real-world inputs as a test-bench. The results show that our approach matches or dominates the performances of production-grade LR parsers in sequential execution, and achieves significant speedups and good scaling on multi-core machines. The work is concluded by a broad and critical survey of the past work on parallel parsing and future directions on the integration with semantic analysis and incremental parsing.}

Odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) are abundant in the sensillar lymph of insect antennae and participate in olfactory perireceptor events, such as transport of the hydrophobic odorant through the aqueous medium, presentation of the odor to olfactory receptors, and deactivation of the signal. This chapter describes the biochemistry and molecular biology of pheromone detection in the noctuid moth, Mamestra brassicae. The OBPs are diverse ranging from numerous species of several insect orders including Lepidoptera, Diptera, Coleoptera, and Hymenoptera, Hemiptera, and Phasmatodea. Classification defines OBP-Type 1 and OBP-Type 2 based on phylogeny, tissue localization, and structural features. The advantage of the functional approach to characterize the diversity of OBPs inside species is characterized. The construction of EST antennal libraries with a high EST number to be representative of the sequence diversity has identified not only new OBPs, but also SAPs, pheromone-degrading enzymes, sensory-neuron-membrane-protein-like sequences, and other elements involved in the pheromone transduction process.}

abstract = {When dealing with safety–critical systems, various regulations, standards, and guidelines stipulate stringent requirements for certification and traceability of artifacts, but typically lack details with regards to the corresponding software engineering process. Given the industrial practice of only using semi-formal notations for describing engineering processes – with the lack of proper tool mapping – engineers and developers need to invest a significant amount of time and effort to ensure that all steps mandated by quality assurance are followed. The sheer size and complexity of systems and regulations make manual, timely feedback from Quality Assurance (QA) engineers infeasible. In order to address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel framework for tracking, and “passively” executing processes in the background, automatically checking QA constraints depending on process progress, and informing the developer of unfulfilled QA constraints. We evaluate our approach by applying it to three case studies: a safety–critical open-source community system, a safety–critical system in the air-traffic control domain, and a non-safety–critical, web-based system. Results from our analysis confirm that trace links are often corrected or completed after the work step has been considered finished, and the engineer has already moved on to another step. Thus, support for timely and automated constraint checking has significant potential to reduce rework as the engineer receives continuous feedback already during their work step.}

In this context, we provide a comprehensive systematic literature review to discover which approaches exist to support the configuration process of extended product lines and how these approaches perform in practice.

Starting from established Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIPs) such as Content-based Router and Aggregator, EIP compositions are built to describe, implement, and execute integration scenarios. The EIPs and their compositions must be correct at design and runtime in order to avoid functional errors or incomplete functionalities. However, current EAI system vendors use many of the EIPs as part of their proprietary integration scenario modeling languages that are not grounded on any formalism. This renders correctness guarantees for EIPs and their composition impossible. Thus this work advocates responsible EAI based on the formalization, implementation, and correctness of EIPs. For this, requirements on an EIP formalization are collected and based on these requirements an extension of db-net, i.e., timed db-net , is proposed, fully equipped with execution semantics. It is shown how EIPs can be realized based on timed db-nets and how the correctness of these realizations can be shown. Moreover, the simulation of EIP realizations based on timed db-nets is enabled which is essential for later implementation. The concepts are evaluated in many ways, including a proof-of-concept implementation and case studies. The EIP formalization based on timed db-nets constitutes the first step towards responsible EAI.}

A single group, within-subjects design was utilized to explore individual and group data from functional questionnaires and behavioral test measures administered, designed to assess school- and home-based listening abilities, once with and once without RM technology. Because some of the children were unable to complete the behavioral test measures, particular focus was given to the functional questionnaires completed by primary teachers, participants, and parents. Behavioral test measures with and without the RM technology included speech recognition in noise, auditory comprehension, and acceptable noise levels. The individual and group teacher (n=8–9), parent (n=8–9), and participant (n=9) questionnaire ratings revealed substantially less listening difficulty when RM technology was used compared to the no-device ratings. On the behavioral measures, individual data revealed varied findings, which will be discussed in detail in the results section. However, on average, the use of the RM technology resulted in improvements in speech recognition in noise (4.6dB improvement) in eight children, higher auditory working memory and comprehension scores (12–13 point improvement) in seven children, and acceptance of poorer signal-to-noise ratios (8.6dB improvement) in five children. The individual and group data from this study suggest that RM technology may improve auditory function in children with ASD in the classroom, at home, and in social situations. However, variability in the data and the inability of some children to complete the behavioral measures indicates that individualized assistive technology evaluations including functional questionnaires will be necessary to determine if the RM technology will be of benefit to a particular child who has ASD.}

Context-awareness challenges the engineering of contemporary software systems and jeopardizes their testing. The variation of context represents a relevant behavior that deepens the limitations of available software testing practices and technologies. However, such software systems are mainstream. Therefore, researchers in non-academic settings also face challenges when developing and testing contemporary software systems.
Objective
To understand how researchers deal with the variation of context when testing context-aware software systems developed in non-academic settings.
Method
To undertake a secondary study (Rapid Review) to uncover the necessary evidence from primary sources describing the testing of context-aware software systems outside academia.
Results
The current testing initiatives in non-academic settings aim to generate or improve test suites that can deal with the context variation and the sheer volume of test input possibilities. They mostly rely on modeling the systems' dynamic behavior and increasing computing resources to generate test inputs to achieve this. We found no evidence of test results aiming at managing context variation through the testing lifecycle process.
Conclusions
So far, the identified testing initiatives and strategies are not ready for mainstream adoption. They are all domain-specific, and while the ideas and approaches can be reproduced in distinct settings, the technologies are to be re-engineered and tailored to the context-awareness of contemporary software systems in different problem domains. Further and joint investigations in academia and experiences in non-academic settings can evolve the body of knowledge regarding the testing of contemporary software systems in the field.}

In this review, we provide information gathered from key findings dealing with the mechanisms of beta deposition in cerebral arteries, the diagnosis of different CAA types, and advances in treatment for CAA. Since CAA is a risk factor for ICH, we also review previously used in vivo and in vitro models of CAA and their features with respect to CAA-related ICH. Currently available transgenic mouse models of CAA show a limited occurrence of hemorrhage at variable locations, which often do not produce any obvious neurological deficits. Thus, the development of novel models to more closely mimic the clinical condition of CAA-related ICH is warranted.}

abstract = {Background
Bidirectional communication between the gut microbiota and the brain may play an essential role in the cognitive dysfunction associated with chronic sleep deprivation(CSD). Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (Danshen, DS), a famous Chinese medicine and functional tea, is extensively used to protect learning and memory capacities, although the mechanism of action remains unknown.
Purpose
The purpose of this research was to explore the efficacy and the underlying mechanism of DS in cognitive dysfunction caused by CSD.
Methods
DS chemical composition was analyzed by UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS. Forty rats were randomly assigned to five groups (n = 8): control (CON), model (MOD), low- (1.35 g/kg, DSL), high-dose (2.70 g/kg, DSH) DS group, and Melatonin(100 mg/kg, MT) group. A CSD rat model was established over 21 days. DS's effects and the underlying mechanism were explored using the open-field test(OFT), Morris water-maze(MWM), tissue staining(Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining, Nissl staining, Alcian blue-periodic acid SCHIFF staining, and Immunofluorescence), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blot, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction(qPCR), and 16S rRNA sequencing.
Results
We demonstrated that CSD caused gut dysbiosis and cognitive dysfunction. Furthermore, 16S rRNA sequencing demonstrated that Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were more in fecal samples from model group rats, whereas Bacteroidota and Spirochaetota were less. DS therapy, on the contrary hand, greatly restored the gut microbial community, consequently alleviating cognitive impairment in rats. Further research revealed that DS administration reduced systemic inflammation via lowering intestinal inflammation and barrier disruption. Following that, DS therapy reduced Blood Brain Barrier(BBB) and neuronal damage, further decreasing neuroinflammation in the hippocampus(HP). Mechanistic studies revealed that DS therapy lowered lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels in the HP, serum, and colon, consequently blocking the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway and its downstream pro-inflammatory products(IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, iNOS, and COX2) in the HP and colon.
Conclusion
DS treatment dramatically improved spatial learning and memory impairments in rats with CSD by regulating the composition of the intestinal flora, preserving gut and brain barrier function, and reducing inflammation mediated by the LPS-TLR4 signaling pathway. Our findings provide novel insight into the mechanisms by which DS treats cognitive dysfunction caused by CSD.}

Animal studies demonstrate a similar female sensitivity to stress and have been used to examine the underlying neurobiology of sex-specific effects of stress. Although our understanding of the sex-specific effects of chronic adolescent stress has grown in recent years, few studies have reported the effects of adolescent stress on depressive-like behavior. The purpose of this study was to determine if a chronic mixed modality stressor (consisting of isolation, restraint, and social defeat) during adolescence (PND 37–49) resulted in differential and sustained changes in depressive-like behavior in male and female Wistar rats. Female rats exposed to chronic adolescent stress displayed decreased sucrose consumption, hyperactivity in the elevated plus maze, decreased activity in the forced swim test, and a blunted corticosterone response to an acute forced swim stress compared to controls during both adolescence (PND 48–57) and adulthood (PND 96–104). Male rats exposed to chronic adolescent stress did not manifest significant behavioral changes at either the end of adolescence or in adulthood. These data support the proposition that adolescence may be a stress sensitive period for females and exposure to stress during adolescence results in behavioral effects that persist in females. Studies investigating the sex-specific effects of chronic adolescent stress may lead to a better understanding of the sexually dimorphic incidence of depressive and anxiety disorders in humans and ultimately improve prevention and treatment strategies.}

The current study examined the effects of neonatal amygdala lesions on defensive, emotional, and neuroendocrine reactivity of infant rhesus monkeys reared with their mothers in large species-typical social groups. Monkeys received either bilateral MRI-guided ibotenic acid amygdala (Neo-A; n=16) or sham (Neo-C; n=12) lesions at 24.8±1.2days of age, or served as behavioral control (Neo-BC; n=3). Defensive and emotional responses were assessed using the Human Intruder paradigm as infants and as juveniles (2.5 and 12months of age, respectively), whereas neuroendocrine reactivity was only examined during the juvenile period. As infants, Neo-A animals expressed similar levels of freezing and hostile behaviors as compared to controls, whereas during the juvenile period Neo-A animals expressed significantly less freezing compared to controls. Interestingly, the sex of the infant modulated the behavioral effects of neonatal amygdalectomy, leading to different patterns of behavior depending on the sex and lesion status of the infant. Unlike controls, Neo-A infants did not modulate their behavioral responses based on the salience of the threat. The impact of neonatal amygdalectomy increased with age, such that Neo-A juveniles exhibited fewer emotional behaviors and increased cortisol response to the stressor as compared to controls. These data indicate that the amygdala plays a critical role in the development of both emotional and neuroendocrine reactivity as well as the expression of sexually dimorphic emotional expression.}

The influence of sex and ovarian hormones on the nociceptive behavior induced by formalin or glutamate was virtually the same. The nociceptive behavior of males was similar to that of females in the proestrus phase of the estrous cycle but was significantly lower than that in the diestrus phase. Since the serum level of estradiol but not of progesterone was significantly higher in the proestrus than in the diestrus phase, these data suggest that females with lower endogenous serum level of estradiol have an exacerbation of TMJ nociception. The nociceptive behavior of ovariectomized rats was similar to that of diestrus females and significantly greater than that of proestrus females. Although the administration of estradiol or progesterone in ovariectomized females significantly reduced TMJ nociception, the combination of both hormones did not increase the antinociceptive effect induced by each of them. These findings suggest that estradiol and progesterone decrease TMJ nociception in an independent way.
Perspective
We report that ovarian hormones have an antinociceptive effect on the TMJ formalin and glutamate nociceptive behavior models. Therefore, the greater prevalence and severity of TMJ pain in women of reproductive age may be a consequence of hormonal fluctuation during the reproductive cycle, in that during low endogenous estradiol serum level TMJ pain sensitivity is increased, enhancing the risk of females experiencing TMJ pain.}

Model-driven architecture based testing (MDABT) adopts architectural models of a system under test and/or its environment to derive test artifacts. In the literature, different MDABT approaches have been provided together with the corresponding lessons results and lessons learned.
Objective
The overall objective of this paper is to identify the published concerns for applying MDABT, identify the proposed solutions, and describe the current research directions for MDABT.
Method
To this end we have provided a systematic literature review (SLR) that is conducted by a multi-phase study selection process using the published literature in major software engineering journals and conference proceedings.

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Although the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) prescription of Danggui Shaoyao San (DSS) presents substantial clinical efficacy and promising clinical prospects, the safety of DSS and its extracts have been inadequately investigated. The larva-adult duality of the zebrafish model offers a more efficient approach for evaluating the safety of herbal preparations in the fields of toxicology and pharmacology.
Aim of the study
To investigate the acute toxicity of the extract derived from Danggui Shaoyao San, a traditional Chinese medicine preparation, on both Danio rerio embryos and adult organisms.
Materials and methods
The components of DSS were identified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The hatching rate of Danio rerio juveniles with different concentrations of DSS was calculated and the morphological changes of juveniles after administration were observed through a microscope. The behavioral trajectory of the adult fish was recorded by the observation tower of the automated Danio rerio analysis system, and DSS's effects on the behavior was analyzed. The pathological changes of Danio rerio gills, livers, kidneys, intestines and spermaries were examined using HE staining.
Results
Compared with the control group, 25, 50 and 100 mg/L of DSS did not elicit any significant impacts on the hatching rate and morphology. Both 200 mg/L and the propylene glycol 2% reduced the hatching rate and caused the morphological teratogenic changes of the juvenile fish. The dosage of DSS below 100 mg/L had no discernible effect on the behavior of the adult fish, whereas the application of propylene glycol 2% was found to stimulate the adult fish, resulting in a notable increase in high-speed movement distance. 100 mg/L DSS group was not observed to cause any noticeable damage to the gills, livers, intestines and spermaries of Danio rerio, only mild nephrotoxicity was detected. The propylene glycol 2% group was found to result in pathological changes such as hyperplasia of epithelial cells on secondary lamellae, liver cell outline loss or atypia, tubal disorganization, goblet cell hypertrophy and irregularly arranged spermatozoa.
Conclusion
A viable approach for conducting toxicological studies on TCM preparations was developed and tested in this research. The findings showed that Danggui Shaoyao San has minimal acute toxicity to embryos and adult organisms at concentrations up to 100 mg/L. These results indicate that Danggui Shaoyao San is a safe TCM preparation.}

The new test generation method generates realistic tests by ignoring the sensitivity list of a process statement and identifying the type of the behavior described by the statements inside the process statement (two types of behavior - synchronous and asynchronous, are defined.). A systematic way of converting a VHDL model to one suitable for checking the validity of the generated tests is presented. A method of further compacting the generated tests is also presented. Finally, an approach to generating tests in the presence of different types of bus resolution functions is discussed.}

abstract = {Congenital or early-onset unilateral hearing loss (UHL) can disrupt the normal development of the auditory system. In extreme cases of UHL (i.e., single sided deafness), consistent cochlear implant use during sensitive periods resulted in cortical reorganization that partially reversed the detrimental effects of unilateral sensory deprivation. There is a gap in knowledge, however, regarding cortical plasticity i.e. the brain's capacity to adapt, reorganize, and develop binaural pathways in milder degrees of UHL rehabilitated by a hearing aid (HA). The current study was set to investigate early-stage cortical processing and electrophysiological manifestations of binaural processing by means of cortical auditory evoked potentials (CAEPs) to speech sounds, in children with moderate to severe-to-profound UHL using a HA. Fourteen children with UHL (CHwUHL), 6-14 years old consistently using a HA for 3.5 (±2.3) years participated in the study. CAEPs were elicited to the speech sounds /m/, /g/, and /t/ in three listening conditions: monaural [Normal hearing (NH), HA], and bilateral [BI (NH + HA)]. Results indicated age-appropriate CAEP morphology in the NH and BI listening conditions in all children. In the HA listening condition: (1) CAEPs showed similar morphology to that found in the NH listening condition, however, the mature morphology observed in older children in the NH listening condition was not evident; (2) P1 was elicited in all but two children with severe-to-profound hearing loss, to at least one speech stimuli, indicating effective audibility; (3) A significant mismatch in timing and synchrony between the NH and HA ear was found; (4) P1 was sensitive to the acoustic features of the eliciting stimulus and to the amplification characteristics of the HA. Finally, a cortical binaural interaction component (BIC) was derived in most children. In conclusion, the current study provides first-time evidence for cortical plasticity and partial reversal of the detrimental effects of moderate to severe-to-profound UHL rehabilitated by a HA. The derivation of a cortical biomarker of binaural processing implies that functional binaural pathways can develop when sufficient auditory input is provided to the affected ear. CAEPs may thus serve as a clinical tool for assessing, monitoring, and managing CHwUHL using a HA.}

Blood T concentrations are relatively low during inter-pulse intervals. Assessment of androgenic influences on MSB of rodents has, with very few exceptions, involved either injections of pure or esterified hormones dissolved in oil or implantation of constant release capsules that generate supraphysiological and/or constantly elevated T concentrations. The minimum daily concentration of T necessary to maintain and restore MSB when T is delivered as a discrete short pulse remains unspecified; nor is it known whether infrequent T pulses in the physiological range sustain MSB. To address these questions, we varied T injection concentrations and frequencies in castrated, sexually-experienced Syrian hamsters. All males injected daily with an aqueous vehicle failed to display the ejaculatory reflex 5 weeks after castration. Once daily 15 μg subcutaneous T injections both maintained and restored MSB, whereas once daily 5 μg T injections resulted in fewer males ejaculating and longer ejaculation latencies. Substantially higher T doses were required to restore MSB in previous studies when T was administered in an oil vehicle. 50 μg T maintained MSB in most hamsters injected once every 4 or 7 days, despite long intervals between injections during which circulating T was undetectable or well below physiological concentrations. Some T regimens that maintained MSB were associated with subnormal seminal vesicle and ventral prostate weights. The demonstration that relatively brief, infrequent elevations of T are sufficient to support MSB provides a useful model to assess the neuroendocrine basis of MSB and raises the possibility that infrequent low dose androgen replacement protocols may restore sex behavior to hypogonadal men without inducing some of the negative side-effects associated with more frequent, higher dose treatments.}

abstract = {Context
In software product line testing (SPLT), test coverage criterion is an important concept, as it provides a means of measuring the extent to which domain testing has been performed and redundant application testing can be avoided based on the test coverage level achieved in domain testing. However, no previous literature reviews on SPLT have addressed test coverage criterion in SPLT.
Objective
The objectives of this paper are as follows: (1) to clarify the notions of test basis and test coverage criterion for SPLT; (2) to identify the test coverage criteria currently used for SPLT; (3) to investigate how various SPLT aspects, such as the SPLT method, variability implementation mechanism, and variability management approach, affect the choice of test coverage criterion for SPLT; and (4) to analyze the limitations of test coverage criteria currently used for SPLT.
Method
This paper conducts a systematic review of test coverage criteria in SPLT with 78 selected studies.
Results
We have several findings that can guide the future research on SPLT. One important finding is that choice of test coverage criterion in SPLT is independent from variability implementation mechanism, variability management, SPL approach, and binding time but is dependent on the variability representation used in development artifacts. Another that is easily overlooked is that SPL test coverage criteria with the same test coverage criterion names of single system testing neither adequately convey what should be covered by the test methods applying them, nor can they be more generally regarded as extensions or generalizations for SPLT of their corresponding test coverage criteria of single system testing.
Conclusion
This study showed that SPL test coverage criteria should be defined or redefined so that they can clearly deliver the target properties to be satisfied by SPLT.}

It has been reported that EE stimulates glucocorticoids release. However, the role of corticosterone (CORT) in effects of EE is still unknown. To address these issues, we examined depression-like behaviors of the animals exposed to EE with low dose CORT supplement following bilateral adrenalectomy (ADX+CORT). Two months after housing, tail suspension test and forced swim test were used to assess depression-related behavior of mice. Serum CORT levels were measured by radio-immunoassay. Signals of DNA synthesis marker bromodeoxyuridine and immature neuronal marker doublecortin were measured by immunohistochemistry. Results showed that EE significantly decreased immobility time of the mice in both the tail suspension test and forced swim test, showing distinctive antidepressive behaviors. Exposure to EE also increased serum CORT level, and prevention of this increase with ADX+CORT eliminated the decrease of immobility time of the animals. Both the mice exposed to EE and those receiving ADX+CORT treatment showed enhanced newly born cells and immature granule neurons in the hippocampus. Taken together, our data suggest that glucocorticoids elevation is required for antidepressive behaviors of EE.}

Typically, all individuals of several species cease to display the ejaculatory reflex within a few weeks of castration. The present study documents the persistence of the ejaculatory reflex 19 weeks after orchidectomy in 40% of male Siberian hamsters maintained in long or short day lengths; testosterone was undetectable in the circulation of these animals. Intact hamsters transferred from a long to a short photoperiod underwent gonadal regression: 50% of these animals continued to display mating behavior culminating in ejaculation throughout 25 weeks of testing. The remaining animals failed to ejaculate after approximately 11 weeks of short day treatment but resumed mating coincident with spontaneous gonadal recrudescence. Activation of sex behavior in the latter cohort appears to depend on gonadal steroids and is in contrast to the copulatory behavior of the substantial proportion of the study population that sustains the full sexual repertoire in the long-term absence of gonadal steroids. Sex behavior of the latter animals may be dependent on nongonadal steroids or mediation by steroid-independent mechanisms.}

Testosterone (T) pulse duration, amplitude, frequency, and inter-pulse interval may be as important as total amount of hormone in determining target tissue responsiveness. We remain ignorant of the number and duration of daily T pulses necessary and sufficient to sustain male mating behavior. An in-dwelling infusion system was employed to vary T-pulse frequencies and durations. Daily 4 h infusions of aqueous T (100 μg/0.064 ml) and twice daily 4 h pulses of T (each 50 μg/0.064 ml) were sufficient to maintain ejaculatory behavior of sexually experienced castrated hamsters for 11 weeks post-castration; castrated hamsters infused with vehicle ceased to display the ejaculatory pattern 3 weeks after gonadectomy. Circulating T concentrations of hormone-infused hamsters declined markedly 7 h after the termination of each infusion. These results establish that male sex behavior can be sustained with infusions of relatively low T concentrations for 4 h/day and suggests that the basal concentrations of T sustained by the gonad during inter-pulse intervals may not be necessary for maintenance of sex behavior. 4 h T infusions were sufficient to maintain penile and seminal vesicles weights, but not ventral prostate weights or flank gland dimensions; the threshold for maintaining male sex behavior is lower than that for some androgen-dependent peripheral structures. Development of effective androgen replacement regimens that sustain sex behavior in castrated animals may be useful in the design of androgen replacement therapy for hypogonadal men.}

The transport of PTX in large cationic liposomes could avoid this undesirable effect, improving the patient’s prognosis. PTX was encapsulated in cationic liposomes with two different sizes, MLV (180−200 nm) and SUV (80−100 nm). In both cases, excellent biocompatibility and improved internalization and antitumor effect of PTX were observed in human and mice lung cancer cells in culture, multicellular spheroids and cancer stem cells (CSCs). In addition, both MLV and SUV with a polyethylene glycol (PEG) shell, induced a greater tumor volume reduction than PTX (56.4 % and 57.1 % vs. 36.7 %, respectively) in mice. Interestingly, MLV-PEG-PTX did not induce either mechanical or heat hypersensitivity whereas SUV-PEG-PTX produced a similar response to free PTX. Analysis of PTX distribution showed a very low concentration of the drug in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) with MLV-PEG-PTX, but not with SUV-PEG-PTX or free PTX. These results support the hypothesis that PTX induces peripheral neuropathy by penetrating the endothelial fenestrations of the DRG (80−100 nm, measured in mice). In conclusion, our larger liposomes (MLV-PEG-PTX) not only showed biocompatibility, antitumor activity against CSCs, and in vitro and in vivo antitumor effect that improved PTX free activity, but also protected from PTX-induced painful peripheral neuropathy. These advantages could be used as a new strategy of lung cancer chemotherapy to increase the PTX activity and reduce its side effects.}

Hamsters housed in winter-like short photoperiods (SP) can express significantly higher levels of aggression than hamsters housed in long photoperiods (LP) that mimic summer. The mechanisms responsible for increasing aggressiveness in SP-exposed female hamsters are not well understood but may involve seasonal changes in the endocrine system. In experiment 1, the effects of SP exposure on the circulating levels of three adrenal hormones were determined. Short photoperiod exposure was found to significantly depress the circulating levels of cortisol and the adrenal androgen dehydropiandrosterone (DHEA) but significantly increased the circulating levels of the sulfated form of DHEA, DHEAS. Experiment 2 examined the effects of gonadal hormones on several different measures of aggression including its intensity in females housed in both long and short photoperiod. Exposure to SP resulted in high levels of aggression regardless of the endocrine state of the animal or the measure used to quantify aggression. In contrast, administration of estradiol to hamsters housed in LP significantly reduced aggression. The data of the present study support the hypothesis that SP-housed females are more aggressive than LP-housed females because SP exposure renders females insensitive to the aggression-reducing effects of ovarian hormones.}

Individuals with a white stripe (WS) on the crown engage in an aggressive strategy that involves more singing, whereas individuals with a tan stripe (TS) sing less and engage in more parental care. Previous work has shown that plasma levels of gonadal steroids differ between the morphs in both sexes, suggesting a hormonal mechanism for the polymorphic behavior in this species. Here, we eliminated morph differences in plasma levels of testosterone (T) in males and estradiol (E2) in females in order to test whether morph differences in behavior would be similarly eliminated. Males and females in non-breeding condition were treated with T or E2, respectively, so that plasma levels in the treated groups were high and equal between the WS and TS morphs. We found that despite hormone treatment, WS and TS birds differed with respect to singing behavior. WS males sang more in response to song playback than did TS males, and WS females exhibited more spontaneous song than TS females. We also found that WS males gave more chip calls, which are often used in contexts of territorial aggression. Overall, these results suggest that WS birds engage in more territorial vocalization, particularly song, than do TS birds, even when T or E2 levels are experimentally equalized. This behavioral difference may therefore be driven by other factors, such as steroid metabolism, receptor expression or function, or steroid-independent neurotransmitter systems.}

Here, we used a prenatal stress model of maternal depression to test the hypothesis that in utero antidepressant treatment could mitigate the effects of prenatal stress. We also investigated the effects of prenatal stress and antidepressant treatment on gene expression related to GABAergic and serotonergic neurotransmission in the amygdala, which may underlie behavioral effects of prenatal stress. Nulliparous female rats were implanted with osmotic minipumps delivering clinically-relevant concentrations of escitalopram and mated. Pregnant dams were exposed to 12 days of mixed-modality stressors, and offspring were behaviorally assessed in adolescence (postnatal day 28) and adulthood (beyond day 90) to determine the extent of behavioral change. We found that in utero stress exposure, regardless of escitalopram treatment, increased anxiety-like behavior in adolescent females and profoundly influenced amygdala expression of the chloride transporters KCC2 and NKCC1, which regulate GABAergic function. In contrast, prenatal escitalopram exposure alone elevated amygdala expression of 5-HT1A receptors. In adulthood, anxiety-like behavior returned to baseline and gene expression effects in the amygdala abated, whereas deficits emerged in novel object recognition for rats exposed to stress during gestation. These findings suggest prenatal stress causes age-dependent deficits in anxiety-like behavior and amygdala function in female offspring, regardless of antidepressant exposure.}

For each rat, sexual behavior was tested with receptive female rats before castration, and after 2weeks of either oil alone (as a control) or oil plus estradiol (E2) treatment administered via Silastic tubes implanted immediately, at 1month (Short-Term), or at 3months (Long-Term) after castration. Intromission frequency decreased and genital sniffing frequency increased significantly after castration compared to pre-castration levels, regardless of the testing time post-castration. E2 treatment at any time point did not reverse these changes. However, more E2-treated than control rats exhibited mounting behavior, with a significant difference between the Long-Term groups. Mounting frequency did not differ from pre-castration levels for either E2 or control rats under the Immediate condition, but declined significantly in rats treated with oil only under both the Short- and Long-Term conditions. In contrast, E2 treatment elevated mounting frequency above the castrate levels to a similar extent in both the Short and Long-term groups. In conclusion, E2 administration partially restores sexual interest in castrated male rats, and the length of post-castration delay in E2 administration does not affect the ability of E2 to restore mounting behavior.}

abstract = {The gonadal hormone testosterone (T) regulates aggression across a wide range of vertebrate species. Recent evidence suggests that the adrenal prohormone dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) may also play an important role in regulating aggression. DHEA can be converted into active sex steroids, such as T and estradiol (E2), within the brain. Previous studies show that circulating DHEA levels display diurnal rhythms and that melatonin increases adrenal DHEA secretion in vitro. Here we examined serum DHEA and T levels in long-day housed Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus), a nocturnal species in which melatonin treatment increases aggression. In Experiment 1, serum DHEA and T levels were measured in adult male hamsters during the day (1200 h, noon) and night (2400 h, midnight). In Experiment 2, aggression was elicited using 5-min resident–intruder trials during the day (1800 h) and night (2000 h) (lights-off at 2000 h). Serum DHEA and T levels were measured 24 h before and immediately after aggressive encounters. In Experiment 1, there was no significant difference in serum DHEA or T levels between noon and midnight, although DHEA levels showed a trend to be lower at midnight. In Experiment 2, territorial aggression was greater during the night than the day. Moreover, at night, aggressive interactions rapidly decreased serum DHEA levels but increased serum T levels. In contrast, aggressive interactions during the day did not affect serum DHEA or T levels. These data suggest that nocturnal aggressive encounters rapidly increase conversion of DHEA to T and that melatonin may play a permissive role in this process.}

We investigated the effects of a 4h maternal and littermate deprivation on behavioral reactions, stress hormone responses and brain corticosteroid receptor expression in 7-, 21- and 35-day-old domestic piglets (Sus scrofa) that were left alone or in the presence either of a familiar or unfamiliar age-matched piglet. Compared to control animals, all of the socially deprived piglets showed significant stress responses, such as impaired habituation in repeated open-field/novel-object tests, enhanced ACTH and cortisol release, and altered corticosteroid receptor expression in the hypothalamus. In addition, our results demonstrated that younger piglets had more difficulty coping with stress. The presence of an age-matched conspecific had a direct calming effect on the deprived piglet during the deprivation procedure, which was revealed by diminished stress-induced HPA activity and altered reactions in the behavioral test situations (e.g., activity, escape, and vocalization). Furthermore, because the presence of a familiar piglet causes a more pronounced buffering effect, we have shown for the first time that the degree of familiarity between the piglets may influence the effectiveness of social support. Our study emphasizes the benefits of social partners on positive welfare and the ability for pigs to cope with stress; therefore, our results should be taken into account during handling practices such as weaning and mixing.}

The important process of neurogenesis in the hippocampus, which includes the production, maturation and integration of new neurons, is affected by TBI due to microglia activation and the inflammatory response. During brain development, microglia are involved in forming or removing synapses, regulating the number of neurons, and repairing damage. However, in response to injury, activated microglia release a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and other neurotoxic mediators that exacerbate post-TBI injury. These microglia-related changes can negatively affect hippocampal neurogenesis and disrupt learning and memory processes. To date, the intracellular signaling pathways that trigger microglia activation following TBI, as well as the effects of microglia on hippocampal neurogenesis, are poorly understood. In this review article, we discuss the effects of microglia-induced neuroinflammation on hippocampal neurogenesis following TBI, as well as the intracellular signaling pathways of microglia activation.}

Ischaemic stroke results from acute arterial occlusion leading to focal hypoperfusion. Thrombolysis is the only proven treatment. Advanced neuroimaging techniques allow a detailed assessment of the cerebral circulation in patients with acute stroke, and provide information about the status of collateral vessels and collateral blood flow, which could attenuate the effects of arterial occlusion. Imaging of the brain and vessels has shown that collateral flow can sustain brain tissue for hours after the occlusion of major arteries to the brain, and the augmentation or maintenance of collateral flow is therefore a potential therapeutic target. Several interventions that might augment collateral blood flow are being investigated.}

The current study investigated the long-term effects of neonatal hippocampal lesions (Neo-Hibo) on emotional and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis functioning. During infancy, unlike controls, Neo-Hibo monkeys exhibited enhanced expression of emotional behaviors (e.g. freezing, anxiety-like, and self-directed behaviors) when exposed to a human intruder (HI task). Upon reaching adulthood, they exhibited reduced freezing and hostility, but increased anxiety-like and self-directed behaviors during the HI task. Neo-Hibo monkeys behaved as if they systematically over-rated the risk inherent in the HI task, which supports Gray and McNaughton’s septo-hippocampal theory of anxiety. Also, in adulthood, the increased levels of anxiety-like behaviors in Neo-Hibo monkeys were associated with a blunted cortisol response to the HI task. Examination of basal HPA axis function revealed that Neo-Hibo monkeys exhibited the typical diurnal cortisol decline throughout the day, but had lower cortisol concentrations in the morning as compared to controls. Taken together these data suggest that an intact hippocampus during development plays a larger role beyond that of inhibitory/negative feedback regulation of the HPA axis stress-activation, and may be critical for HPA axis basal functioning as well as for the stress response. The behavioral and neuroendocrine changes demonstrated in the current study are reminiscent of those seen in human or nonhuman primates with adult-onset hippocampal damage, demonstrating little functional compensation following early hippocampal damage.}

abstract = {In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the deployment of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) in critical missions like search and rescue, surveillance, and environmental monitoring. During a mission, the UAS experiences changes, referred to as interruptions, requiring self-adaptation, i.e., an adjustment in its behavior at run-time. This adaptation is crucial due to the mission’s inherent critical nature involving engagement with humans, structures, and neighboring unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Testing the application software that defines its mission and behavior is mandatory to ensure the accurate adaptation of its behavior. For this, the primary challenge involves the flight of a UAS, followed by the identification of test cases ensuring the execution of necessary self-adaptive behaviors during a UAS flight. The current industrial practice of testing self-adaptive behaviors in UAS involves manual testing, a time-consuming method that restricts the execution to a limited set of test cases. To address this problem, we propose a hybrid approach to test the self-adaptive behavior of UAS application software. As part of the approach, we propose a modeling methodology to capture the application requirements for the UAS mission and the self-adaptive behavior. We then use the developed models and a search-based algorithm to automate the generation and execution of test cases. We have created a prototype tool to facilitate the automation of testing activities. The work is conducted in collaboration with an industrial partner and demonstrated through a case study of UAS formation flight application software. We have effectively modeled the case study concepts with the proposed modeling methodology. Employing our testing approach, we have detected ten unique faults within the formation flight application software. Additionally, statistical analysis indicates that the proposed approach outperforms the baseline random search in fault detection using a genetic algorithm.}

However, current literature depicts an inconsistent pattern in altricial vs. semi-precocial species, with stimulating versus inhibitory effects of the hormone respectively. This is possibly due to a difference in the methodology of hormone treatment (short-term moderate dose versus a long-term stronger elevation, respectively) between the studies performed so far. In this study, we induced short-term moderate peaks in plasma testosterone levels, as applied in altricial bird species, and assessed the effects of our manipulation on begging, competitive and aggressive behavior in black-headed gull (Larus ridibundus) chicks, a semi-precocial species. Our results suggest that, unlike in altricial songbirds, temporary increase of plasma testosterone concentration suppresses begging and enhances aggressiveness towards intruders. However, it also increases aggression and the chances of getting priority while scrambling with nest mates to gain access to food. Thus, the inconsistencies in the hormonal control of begging behavior observed between altricial vs. semi-precocial birds seem real and perhaps related to species differences in complexity of the display and the nature of competition. These may be elucidated by future comparative studies.}

We investigated the relationships among testosterone, androgen receptor (AR) and estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) cell numbers in the hypothalamus, and their relationship to sexual performance in male rats. Young (3months) and middle-aged (12months) rats were given sexual behavior tests, then castrated and implanted with vehicle or testosterone capsules. Rats were tested again for sexual behavior. Numbers of AR and ERα immunoreactive cells were counted in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus and the medial preoptic nucleus, and serum hormones were measured. Middle-aged intact rats had significant impairments of all sexual behavior measures compared to young males. After castration and testosterone implantation, sexual behaviors in middle-aged males were largely comparable to those in the young males. In the hypothalamus, AR cell density was significantly (5-fold) higher, and ERα cell density significantly (6-fold) lower, in testosterone- than vehicle-treated males, with no age differences. Thus, restoration of serum testosterone to comparable levels in young and middle-aged rats resulted in similar preoptic AR and ERα cell density concomitant with a reinstatement of most behaviors. These data suggest that age-related differences in sexual behavior cannot be due to absolute levels of testosterone, and further, the middle-aged brain retains the capacity to respond to exogenous testosterone with changes in hypothalamic AR and ERα expression. Our finding that testosterone replacement in aging males has profound effects on hypothalamic receptors and behavior has potential medical implications for the treatment of age-related hypogonadism in men.}

These desert finches are opportunistic breeders, and breeding is highly influenced by unpredictable rainfall. Their high levels of affiliation and complex breeding patterns make zebra finches an excellent model in which to study the endocrine regulation of affiliation. Here, we compared zebra finch pairs that were provided with water ad libitum (control) or water restricted. We examined (1) reproductive physiology, (2) pair-maintenance behaviors in several contexts, and (3) circulating and brain steroid levels. In females, water restriction profoundly reduced largest ovarian follicle size, ovary size, oviduct size, and egg laying. In males, water restriction had no effect on testes size but decreased systemic testosterone levels. However, in the hypothalamus, local testosterone and estradiol levels were unaffected by water restriction in both sexes. Systemic and local levels of the androgen precursor dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) were also unaffected by water restriction. Lastly, in three different behavioral paradigms, we examined a variety of pair-maintenance behaviors, and none were reduced by water restriction. Taken together, these correlational data are consistent with the hypothesis that local production of sex steroids in the brain promotes the expression of pair-maintenance behaviors in non-breeding zebra finches.}

However, whether PMV neurons modulate the reproductive neural circuitry and/or the expression of sexual behaviors has not been determined. Here, we showed that the expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors in the PMV is modulated by changing levels of sex steroids across the estrous cycle. We also showed that sexual behavior, not the high physiologic levels of sex steroids, induces Fos in PMV neurons. Bilateral lesions of the PMV caused no significant changes in proceptive behavior but a high percentage of PMV-lesioned rats failed to exhibit lordosis behavior when exposed to a sexually experienced male rat (50% vs. 18% in the control group). Notably, lesions of the PMV disrupted the physiologic fluctuations of Kiss1 and GnRH mRNA expression characteristic of the proestrus-to-estrus transition. This neurochemical imbalance may ultimately alter female reproductive behavior. Our findings suggest that the PMV is a component of the neural circuitry that modulates the physiologic fluctuations of key neuroendocrine players (i.e., Kiss1 and GnRH) in the control of the female reproductive physiology.}

In Experiment 1, we tested the hypothesis that CD varies over the estrous cycle and found that previously defeated female hamsters tested on diestrus 2 and proestrus were more likely to exhibit CD than were females tested on diestrus 1 and estrus. In Experiment 2, we found that regardless of hormonal status, non-defeated females displayed normal territorial aggression, indicating that the behavioral changes observed in Experiment 1 were not due to a cyclic variation in submissive behavior independent of a previous defeat encounter. In Experiment 3, we found that females tested 4 days after defeat responded similarly to those tested 1 day after defeat suggesting that the hormonal status of females on the day of testing is a more important determinant of the behavioral response to defeat than is the hormonal status on the day of defeat training. Finally, in Experiment 4, we monitored anxiety-like behaviors in diestrous 1 and proestrous females in an open field arena and found that there was no effect of cycle on any of the observed behavioral measures, suggesting that the observed differences in CD are not the result of differences in generalized anxiety-like behaviors across the estrous cycle.}

Participants in the treatment, but not control, group significantly improved in the treated language domain. FMRI region-of-interest (ROI) analyses, conducted within regions that were either active (or homologous to active) regions in a group of 22 healthy participants on the story comprehension task, revealed a significant increase in activation from pre-to post-treatment in right-hemisphere homologues of these regions for participants in the sentence and spelling, but not naming, treatment groups, not predicted by left-hemisphere lesion size. For the sentence (but not the spelling) treatment group, activation changes within right-hemisphere homologues of language regions were positively associated with changes in measures of verb and sentence comprehension. These findings support previous research pointing to recruitment of right hemisphere tissue as a viable route for language recovery and suggest that sentence-level treatment may promote greater neuroplasticity on naturalistic, language comprehension tasks, compared to word-level treatment.}

Safety is of paramount importance for cyber–physical systems in domains such as automotive, robotics, and avionics. Formal methods such as model checking are one way to ensure the safety of cyber–physical systems. However, adoption of formal methods in industry is hindered by usability issues, particularly the difficulty of understanding model checking results.
Objective:
We want to provide an overview of the state of the art for counterexample explanation by investigating the contexts, techniques, and evaluation of research approaches in this field. This overview shall provide an understanding of current and guide future research.
Method:
To provide this overview, we conducted a systematic literature review. The survey comprises 116 publications that address counterexample explanations for model checking.
Results:
Most primary studies provide counterexample explanations graphically or as traces, minimize counterexamples to reduce complexity, localize errors in the models expressed in the input formats of model checkers, support linear temporal logic or computation tree logic specifications, and use model checkers of the Symbolic Model Verifier family. Several studies evaluate their approaches in safety-critical domains with industrial applications.
Conclusion:
We notably see a lack of research on counterexample explanation that targets probabilistic and real-time systems, leverages the explanations to domain-specific models, and evaluates approaches in user studies. We conclude by discussing the adequacy of different types of explanations for users with varying domain and formal methods expertise, showing the need to support laypersons in understanding model checking results to increase adoption of formal methods in industry.}

Females may use conspicuous secondary sexual characteristics of males such as courtship display to distinguish among high and low quality males. Testosterone (T) controls a large suite of secondary sexual characteristics and variation in T concentrations may account of differences in courtship rates. Two studies were conducted to examine the relationship between T concentrations and courtship rate and its role in mammalian female mate choice. Experiment 1 utilized bucks (intact males) and Experiment 2 utilized T-replaced wethers (castrated pre-pubertally). During the first year of Experiment 2, T-replaced wethers received either vehicle control (CON), 25mg or 100mg testosterone propionate (TP). During the second year of Experiment 2, T-replaced wethers were treated with either 5mg, 15mg or 25mg TP. For all experiments, mean courtship rates and circulating T concentrations were measured, as well as female preference for males displaying different courtship frequencies. T concentrations and courtship rate were positively correlated for bucks and estrous females preferred high courting bucks. Males receiving 25mg and 100mg TP courted females at a similar rate, but both were significantly higher than courtship rates of the CON wethers. Courtship rates of the 25mg, 15mg and 5mg TP-treated males were all significantly different. Females did not show a preference between the 100mg or 25mg TP-treated wethers, however both were preferred in comparison to the CON wethers. Females did not show preference between the 25mg or 15mg TP-treated wethers, however both were preferred in comparison to the 5mg TP-treated wethers. Taken together, these studies suggest that courtship rate is T-dependent. Further, females can use courtship rate to distinguish among males.}

The current study examined the long-term effects of neonatal amygdala lesions on emotional and hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis reactivity to an acute stressor in rhesus monkeys. Rhesus monkeys received either bilateral MRI-guided ibotenic acid amygdala (Neo-Aibo; n=6) or sham (Neo-C; n=7) lesions between 7 and 14 days of age. Emotional reactivity was assessed using the Human Intruder paradigm at 2 months, 4.5 months, and 6–8 years of age, whereas stress neuroendocrine response was only assessed in adulthood (6–8 years). The modulation of defensive and emotional behaviors based on the gaze direction of the intruder emerged between 2 and 4 months of age in surrogate-peer reared sham-operated infant monkeys, as already shown for mother-reared infants. Although neonatal amygdala lesions did not impair the ability to exhibit defensive and emotional behaviors, it altered the modulation of these responses based on the intruder's gaze direction. The changes in emotional reactivity after neonatal amygdala lesions emerged in infancy and persisted throughout adulthood when they were associated with a reduction of basal cortisol levels and a blunted cortisol response to the stressor. These changes are reminiscent of those found after adult-onset amygdala lesions, demonstrating little functional compensation following early amygdala damage.}

abstract = {Background
Testosterone protects male rats from Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ) pain. This study investigated whether this protective effect is mediated by an organizational action of testosterone during nervous system development, by central estrogen and androgen receptors and by the 5α-reduced metabolite of testosterone, dihydrotestosterone.
Methods
A pharmacological approach was used to assess the ability of the androgen receptor antagonist flutamide, the estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182 780 and the 5-α reductase inhibitor dutasteride to block the protective effect of testosterone, evaluated through the behavioral response induced by a TMJ injection of 0.5% formalin. Flutamide and ICI 182 780 were injected into the medullary subarachnoid space, and dutasteride and testosterone were systemically administered.
Results
The TMJ injection of 0.5% formalin induced a significant nociceptive behavioral response in gonadectomized male and naïve female, but not in sham gonadectomized male rats, confirming that endogenous testosterone prevents TMJ nociception in males. Testosterone administration prevented formalin-induced TMJ nociception in males gonadectomized either in the neonatal (at the day of birth) or adult period and in naïve female rats, suggesting that the protective effect of testosterone on TMJ nociception does not depend on its organizational actions during critical periods of development. The administration of flutamide and dutasteride but not of ICI 182 780 blocked the protective effect of testosterone.
Conclusions
We conclude that the protective effect of testosterone on TMJ nociception depends on activational actions of dihydrotestosterone on androgen receptors rather than on organizational androgenic actions during central nervous system development or estrogenic actions.}

This study examines whether α2-adrenoceptor-mediated antinociceptive effects are reduced by estrogen which could account for the sex-related differences in pain perception and modulation. Clonidine, an α2-adrenoceptor agonist, has been shown to inhibit noxious stimulus-evoked nociceptive behavior as well as the responses of nociceptive neurons in the medullary dorsal horn. Intracisternal microinjection of clonidine (7 μg/5 μl) through the implanted PE-10 cannulae dorsal to the trigeminal region in male, ovariectomized (OVX), and diestrous (DiE) Sprague–Dawley rats produced a strong antinociceptive effect on N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA)-induced nociceptive scratching behavior and heat-induced face withdrawal nociceptive tests. However, it failed to produce any inhibition in the estradiol-treated ovariectomized (OVX+E) group regardless of the dose of estradiol (1, 10 or 100 μg/100 μl sesame oil) or in the proestrous (ProE) group. Further, clonidine produced dose-dependent effects in male and OVX groups but not in the OVX+E group on the NMDA-induced nociceptive behavior. Finally, the effect of clonidine was reversed by yohimbine, an α2-adrenoceptor antagonist, in male and OVX groups on thermal nociceptive test. These results lead us to conclude that activation of α2-adrenoceptors produces sex-specific, estrogen dependent modulation of nociception in the trigeminal region of the rat. A decreased α2-adrenoceptor-mediated inhibition could be one of the factors responsible for the higher prevalence of pain syndromes in females.}

The mPOA is a key site involved in mediating actions of androgens and estrogens in the control of masculine sexual behavior, but the respective roles of these hormones is not fully understood. As males age they show impairments in sexual function, and a decreased facilitation of behavior by steroid hormones compared to younger animals. We hypothesized that an anatomical substrate for these behavioral changes is a decline in expression and/or activation of hormone receptor-sensitive cells in the mPOA. We tested this by quantifying and comparing numbers of AR- and ERα-containing cells, and Fos as a marker of activated neurons, in the mPOA of mature (4–5months) and aged (12–13months) male rats, assessed one hour after copulation to one ejaculation. Numbers of AR- and ERα cells did not change with age or after sex, but the percentage of AR- and ERα-cells that co-expressed Fos were significantly up-regulated by sex, independent of age. Age effects were found for the percentage of Fos cells that co-expressed ERα (up-regulated in the central mPOA) and the percentage of Fos cells co-expressing AR in the posterior mPOA. Interestingly, serum estradiol concentrations positively correlated with intromission latency in aged but not mature animals. These data show that the aging male brain continues to have high expression and activation of both AR and ERα in the mPOA with copulation, raising the possibility that differences in relationships between hormones, behavior, and neural activation may underlie some age-related impairments.}

However, like the syntax-based approaches traditionally used to analyze and compare code in the first generation of code search engines, big data technologies are essentially static analysis processes. When dynamic properties of software, such as run-time behavior (i.e., semantics) and performance, are among the search criteria, the exclusive use of static algorithms has a significant negative impact on the precision and recall of the search results as well as other key usability factors such as ranking quality. Therefore, to address these weaknesses and provide a more reliable and usable service, the next generation of code search engines needs to complement static code analysis techniques with equally large-scale, dynamic analysis techniques based on its execution and observation. In this paper we describe a new software platform specifically developed to achieve this by simplifying and largely automating the dynamic analysis (i.e., observation) of code at a large scale. We show how this platform can combine dynamically observed properties of code modules with static properties to improve the quality and usability of code search results.}

Male SD rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: CUMS, FS and controls. Comparisons were made of behavioral changes in CUMS and control rats, plasma levels of corticosterone (CORT), testosterone (T) and estradiol (E2), and of the hypothalamic mRNA-expression of stress-related molecules, i.e. estrogen receptor α and β, androgen receptor, aromatase, mineralocorticoid receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, corticotropin-releasing hormone, arginine vasopressin and oxytocin. CUMS resulted in disordered estrus cycles, more behavioral and hypothalamic stress-related molecules changes and a stronger CORT response in female rats compared with male rats. Female rats also showed decreased E2 and T levels after FS and CUMS, while male FS rats showed increased E2 and male CUMS rats showed decreased T levels. Stress affects the behavioral, endocrine and the molecular response of the stress systems in the hypothalamus of SD rats in a clear sexual dimorphic way, which has parallels in human data on stress and depression.}

The present study aimed to investigate the role of disrupted Notch signaling in the medial prefrontal cortex of the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) mice and Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats. RNA-sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR analyses evidenced the involvement of Notch signaling pathway in depression. Western blotting reported an increased level of Notch2 and NF-κB and a decreased level of Hes1 and Bcl2/Bax ratio both in the susceptible mice when compared with the control or resilient ones and in the depression WKY rats when compared with the Wistar or non-depression WKY groups. Further analysis showed that the above-mentioned changes were significantly correlated with the depression-like behaviors and that the elicited Notch2 strongly correlated with the upregulated NF-κB, not with the downregulated Hes1 or Bcl2/Bax ratio. In conclusion, the increased Notch2/NF-κB signaling in the medial prefrontal cortex may mediate depression susceptibility, providing a potential diagnostic biomarker or therapeutic target for treating major depressive disorder.}

The Forced Swim Test to determine depressive-like and the Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) to evaluate anxiety-like behaviors, were used. We found that DHEA had an anti-depressive-like effect, as shown by a decreased immobility time in mice possessing a high level of frontal cortex DHEA and increased immobility time in mice that have a low frontal cortex DHEA level. DHEA also demonstrated an anti-anxiety-like effect, as shown by the open-arm time in EPM, which correlated with DHEA level. Mice with significantly low DHEA levels when restored to normal, did not differ from controls. In conclusion, high levels of DHEA have an anti-anxiety-like and an anti-depressive-like effect in mice and those with low levels of frontal cortex DHEA are more vulnerable to depression and/or anxiety.}

abstract = {Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) are known to exhibit repetitive pacing behaviors, usually described as stereotypic, in zoo environments. However, little quantitative information exists about the prevalence of pacing in the zoo population. Similarly, large, multi-institutional studies conducted to determine the relationship between stereotypic behavior in zoo polar bears and environmental/husbandry variables using corticoids as a measure of stress are lacking. The study reported here includes data from 55 bears housed in 20 North American zoos. Individual and zoo characteristics were collected and behavior and fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGM) were measured over a one-year period. Using an epidemiological approach, individual and facility level multiple linear regression models were constructed to determine the nature, strength and significance of environmental/husbandry variables and temperament (measured using a standardized novel object behavior test) on stereotypic pacing and FGM. We found zoo polar bears performed stereotypic pacing behavior during 14% of the day; the proportion rose to 22% when expressed as a percentage of time engaged in locomotory behavior. However, considerable variation in proportion of stereotypy was observed. Variables associated with reduced pacing at zoos were: enrichment, number of bears in the group, and bears having a view out of their exhibit with a strong suggestion that the existence of a positive reinforcement training program may also be important. Among individuals, bears whose temperament measured high on the “interest” axis (defined in terms of behavior directed toward the novel object) tended to display less stereotypic behavior and those that scored high on the “slow to approach” axis displayed more pacing. We found higher FGM levels were associated with higher proportions of stereotypic pacing, lower levels of the temperament variable “interest” and smaller dry land exhibit area. These results support other studies suggesting polar bears are particularly prone to stereotypic pacing behavior in zoos and that there is a link between stress (measured as FGM) and pacing in zoo polar bears. These findings also suggest that some easily available tools, namely environmental enrichment and possibly positive reinforcement training, can effectively reduce the incidence of these behaviors. Exhibit designers should take note that providing bears with a view out of their exhibit and larger land areas are associated with both behavioral and physiological benefits. Finally, certain temperaments are associated with elevated levels of both stereotypic behavior and corticoids. This information may provide a tool for proactively identifying the individuals most likely to develop pacing behaviors and providing appropriately enhanced care before the behavior becomes established.}

abstract = {The PLEIADES software environment is devoted to the thermomechanical simulation of nuclear fuel elements behaviour under irradiation. This platform is co-developed in the framework of a research cooperative program between Électricité de France (EDF), AREVA and the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA). As many thermomechanical solvers are used within the platform, one of the PLEAIADES’s main challenge is to propose a unified software environment for capitalisation of material knowledge coming from research and development programs on various nuclear systems. This paper introduces a tool called mfront which is basically a code generator based on C++  (Stroustrup and Eberhardt, 2004). Domain specific languages are provided which were designed to simplify the implementations of new material properties, mechanical behaviours and simple material models. mfront was recently released under the GPL open-source licence and is available on its web site: http://tfel.sourceforge.net/. The authors hope that it will prove useful for researchers and engineers, in particular in the field of solid mechanics. mfront interfaces generate code specific to each solver and language considered. In this paper, after a general overview of mfront functionalities, a particular focus is made on mechanical behaviours which are by essence more complex and may have significant impact on the numerical performances of mechanical simulations. mfront users can describe all kinds of mechanical phenomena, such as viscoplasticity, plasticity and damage, for various types of mechanical behaviour (small strain or finite strain behaviour, cohesive zone models). Performance benchmarks, performed using the Code_Aster finite element solver, show that the code generated using mfront is in most cases on par or better than the behaviour implementations written in fortran natively available in this solver. The material knowledge management strategy that was set up within the PLEIADES platform is briefly discussed. A material database named sirius proposes a rigorous material verification workflow. We illustrate the use of mfront through two case of studies: a simple FFC single crystal viscoplastic behaviour and the implementation of a recent behaviour for the fuel material which describes various phenomena: fuel cracking, plasticity and viscoplasticity.}

Herein, using behavioral and biochemical approaches, we investigated the protective effects of guanosine (GUO) (7.5 mg/kg, i.p.) against emotional impairments and cellular events in cortical, striatal and hippocampal slices of rats submitted to a bilateral infusion of 6-OHDA (10 μg/hemisphere) into the DLS. 6-OHDA-lesioned rats displayed anhedonic- and depressive-like behaviors addressed in the splash and forced swimming tests (at 8 and 21 days after lesion, respectively). In addition, no alterations in motor performance in the open field test and social interaction were observed. Biochemical analyses were performed 22 days after 6-OHDA lesions. 6-OHDA lesion induced hippocampal mitochondrial membrane potential disruption. However, intra-striatal 6-OHDA administration did not alter the ROS levels measured in cortical, striatal and hippocampal slices. GUO treatment attenuated anhedonic- and depressive-like behaviors in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats and protected hippocampal slices against the mitochondrial membrane potential disruption. These results indicate antidepressant-like effects of GUO in a rat model of PD, indicating the potential of GUO for the treatment of depression associated with PD.}

It is well-established that astrocytes activation contributes to the development of PINP. Recent reports showed astrocytes can be divided into A1 and A2 phenotypes. However, whether the transformation of astrocytes participates in PINP and the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. As Notch signaling pathway have shown to be involved in neuropathic pain, we aimed to investigate the relationship between Notch signaling pathway and A1 astrocytes in PINP. Herein we found that both A1 astrocytes and Notch signaling were markedly activated in the spinal cord of PINP rats and the downstream molecules of Notch signaling were colocalized with A1 astrocytes. DAPT (an inhibitor of Notch signaling) not only suppressed the mechanical allodynia of PINP rats, but also inhibited the activation of Notch signaling pathway and A1 astrocytes. Furthermore, Jagged1 (a ligand of Notch1 receptors) dose-dependently induced mechanical hyperalgesia in naïve rats and simultaneously led to Notch signaling activation and A1 astrocytes transformation, all of which were inhibited by DAPT. Taken together, these results demonstrate Notch signaling activation contributes to PINP via A1 astrocytes activation, which provides a promising therapeutic target for PINP.}

Pre-set cut-off behavioral criteria classified exposed animals according to their EPM and ASR response-patterns into “extreme,” “minimal,” or “partial” behavioral response for analysis of prevalence rates of “PTSD-like behavior.” Circulating corticosterone levels were assessed 20min after injection of ketamine in exposed and unexposed animals (N=62). The dexamethasone suppression test was used to assess negative feedback inhibition of the HPA axis. Prevalence rates of extremely-, partially-, or minimally-disrupted behavior demonstrated that ketamine administered immediately following stress exposure was ineffective in alleviating “PTSD-like behavior” at day 30 after exposure. Administration of ketamine was associated with increase in freezing behavior after exposure to a trauma-cue on day 31. Corticosterone levels were significantly suppressed by ketamine only in the exposed animals. Administration of ketamine immediately following trauma-exposure may not only be ineffective but actually detrimental in the long term. A disruption of the post-stress HPA-response has been raised as a contributing factor.}

abstract = {Reactivity to traumatic stress varies between individuals and only a minority of those exposed to trauma develops stress-induced psychopathologies. Currently extensive effort is made to unravel the specific mechanisms predisposing to vulnerability vs. resilience to stress. We investigated in rats the role of β-endorphin metabolism in vulnerability to acute traumatic stress. Responders (showing extreme anxiety; n=7) and resilient non-responders (not differing from the non-stressed individuals; n=8) to traumatic foot-shock stress were compared for their blood levels of stress hormones as well as brain levels and activity of two opioid-degrading enzymes. β-endorphin is a substrate to insulin degrading enzyme, which also degrades insulin. Therefore, the effects of insulin application on behavioral and hormonal responses and on β-endorphin degradation were tested. Pre- and post-stress levels of serum corticosterone, and post-stress plasma β-endorphin concentration differentiated between the responders and the non-responders. In brain, responders showed enhanced degradation rates of β-endorphin, assessed by Liquid Chromatography–Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), in hippocampal and amygdalar slices as compared to non-responders. Application of insulin to the amygdala, prior to exposure to traumatic stress, reduced post-stress anxiety and serum corticosterone levels only in the responders. In parallel, amygdalar β-endorphin degradation rate was also reduced by insulin. These results suggest that slowing down β-endorphin degradation rate may constitute an integral part of the normal stress-response, upon a failure of which an extreme anxiety develops. Modulation of opioid degradation may thus present a potential novel target for interference with extreme anxiety.}

All treated females showed aggressive behavior towards the males to a similar extent irrespective of dose. Fertilization rate, pregnancy, delivery and litter size were normal. Birth weight and growth rates of the pups were also unaffected indicating no deleterious effects of extract on offspring development. The extract had significant effects on preovulatory luteinizing hormone (LH), prolactin (PRL) and progesterone (P4) release. Divided doses of 1.0 and 1.5g/kg significantly decreased preovulatory LH, PRL and P4 release. Administration of 0.5 or 1.5g/kg in bolus dose, produced significant inhibition of preovulatory LH and PRL while 1.5g/kg had no effect. Progesterone was not modified while 1.0g/kg dose caused a decrease in GH. 0.25g/kg produced a paradoxical increase in preovulatory PRL secretion, also seen on day 4 of pregnancy. During pregnancy, both dose regimens were effective in inhibiting the afternoon peaks in prolactin secretion at all dose levels with the exception of 0.25g/kg. There were no effects on the second half of pregnancy or on the suckling-induced PRL release on day 3 postpartum. Circulating GH was scarcely affected on day 3 postpartum. All the results taken together, indicate that the contraceptive effects of the extract may be exerted through interference with neural mechanisms that control preovulatory hormone release and sexual behavior.}

Our method is based on formal models in a dedicated intermediate representation, compiled directly from mixed scores (high-level requirements), and either passed, to the model-checker Uppaal (after conversion to Timed Automata) in the offline approach, or executed by a virtual machine in the online approach. Our fully automatic framework has been applied to real mixed scores used in concerts and the results obtained have permitted to identify bugs in the target IMS.}

In short photoperiods, male hamsters display significantly higher levels of aggression than males housed in long photoperiods. Arginine–vasopressin (AVP) within the anterior hypothalamus (AH) has been reported to modulate aggression in hamsters housed in long photoperiods. Previous studies have shown that AVP can facilitate aggression and its effects appear to be mediated by AVP V1a receptors (V1aR). In the present study, we investigated whether the increased levels of aggression observed after exposure to short photoperiod were the result of an increased responsiveness to AVP within the AH. Injections of AVP into the AH significantly increased aggression in hamsters housed in a long photoperiod, but had no effect in hamsters housed in a short photoperiod. In addition, injection of a V1aR antagonist into the AH significantly inhibited aggression in hamsters housed in long photoperiod, but had no effect in hamsters housed in a short photoperiod. These findings indicate that AVP within the AH increases aggression in hamsters housed in long photoperiods, but not in hamsters housed in short photoperiods.}

Additionally, women are more likely to be affected by stress due to the estrogen fluctuation associated with their menstrual cycle. This study aims to evaluate the effect of chronic restraint stress, applied for 30 days, and estrogen replacement on behavior, glucose level, and the lipid profile of ovariectomized rats. Our results suggest that stress increases sweet food consumption in OVX females treated with estradiol (E2), but reduces consumption in animals not treated. Furthermore, stress increases locomotor activity and anxiety as assessed by the Open Field test and in the Elevated Plus Maze. Similarly, our results suggest that E2 increases anxiety in female rats under the same behavioral tests. In addition, stress reduces glucose and TC levels. Moreover, stress increase TG levels in the presence of E2 and decrease in its absence, as well as the estradiol increase TG levels in stressed groups and reduced in non-stressed groups. Our data suggest an important interaction between stress and estrogen, showing that hormonal status can induce changes in the animal's response to stress.}

abstract = {Background
Converging evidence implicates the regulatory neuropeptide galanin in anxiety- and depression-related behaviors, through modulation of neuroendocrine, serotonergic, and noradrenergic systems. This study examined the relationship between stress-induced posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-like behavioral response patterns in rats and galanin mRNA levels in key brain areas and the effects of acute phase pharmacologic manipulation using an agonist (galnon) on behavioral, physiologic, and response patterns of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and 5-hydroxytryptamine-1A (5HT-1A).
Method
Galanin mRNA expression was assessed in the frontal cortex and hippocampus in the short- and long-term (30 min and 7 days) after exposure to predator scent stress. The effects of intraperitoneal galnon .5 mg/kg versus saline 1 hour postexposure on behavioral tests (elevated plus maze and acoustic startle response) were evaluated 7 days later. Trauma-cue response, circulating corticosterone, and localized brain expression of 5HT-1A receptors and BDNF were subsequently assessed. All data were analyzed in relation to individual behavior patterns.
Results
Whereas animals with minimal behavioral disruption displayed a lasting upregulation of galanin mRNA in the hippocampal CA1 area, those with extreme behavioral responses displayed downregulation in both CA1 and frontal cortex. Immediate postexposure treatment with galnon significantly reduced prevalence rates of extreme responders, reduced trauma-cue freezing responses, corrected the corticosterone response, and increased CA1 expression of 5HT-1A and BDNF mRNA compared with saline controls.
Conclusions
Galanin is actively involved in the neurobiological response to predator scent stress with resilience/recovery after stress exposure and thus warrants further study as a potential therapeutic avenue for the treatment of anxiety-related disorders.}

It is not clear whether estrogen is critical for optimal memory function in middle-aged female animals, i.e. when cyclicity gradually declines. We trained young adult (5 months) and older (10 months) female Long–Evans rats on a win-shift (delay) 12-arm radial maze (7 arms blocked pre-delay). Rats were preoperatively trained to criterion (≤2 errors/trial for 3 days) with no delay then with a 60 s delay. All rats were ovariectomized when the age groups were 9 (Y) and 14 months (MA), respectively. Following recovery and retraining to criterion, each rat underwent consecutive treatment cycles with vehicle (Oil) or 17-β-estradiol benzoate (E). Each 6-day acute treatment cycle, modeled after protocols previously shown to induce morphological and electrophysiological plasticity in the hippocampus at 24–48 h after estrogen injection, consisted of two consecutive daily injections of 10 μg E or Oil (0.1 ml subcutaneously) on Days 1–2 (Oil–Oil or E–E), testing on Days 3–4 at 60 s or 6 h delays, with Days 5–6 comprising of washout days. Each rat received a total of 4 treatment cycles, alternating between Oil and E cycles, in counterbalanced order. Estrogen treatment had no effect in either age group on pre-delay or post-delay errors at either 60 s or 6 h delays. The data indicate that the cyclic estrogen replacement regimen does not influence spatial memory function in young or middle-aged animals in the hippocampal-dependent appetitive radial maze task. Discussion of these unexpected results includes consideration of important experimental design factors that differ between our study and some previous reports, such as the extensive training and task experience our subject received prior to testing for estrogen effects.}

Its effects on the sensorimotor responses of fish, particularly during embryonic stages, may affect population fitness. To address this, zebrafish embryos were exposed to water at pH 7, 5 and 4.5 (adjusted with HCl) for 120 h. Acidic water did not increase mortality or cause obvious morphological abnormalities but reduced the size of the inner ear organs (otic vesicle and otolith) and the eye lens. It also suppressed ion uptake (Na+, Ca2+, K+) and induced embryonic acidosis. Behavioral tests at 4 or 5 days post fertilization revealed significant sensorimotor impairments: reduced touch-evoked escape responses (TEER), decreased acoustic startle responses (ASR) and decreased cadaverine avoidance responses (CAR). There were no effects on speed, acceleration and optomotor responses (OMR). Transcriptomic analyses identified 114 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with ion transport, sensorimotor functions and other physiological processes. Overall, the jeopardizing effect of freshwater acidification threatens survival, highlighting the ecological risks and its potential impacts on fish populations.}

Due to its efficacy at suppressing estrogens, letrozole has recently taken favor as a first-line adjuvant treatment for hormone-responsive breast cancer in middle-aged women. Though patient response to letrozole has generally been positive, there is conflicting evidence surrounding its effects on the development of depression. It is possible that the potential adverse effects of letrozole on mood are a result of the impact of hormonal fluctuations on neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Thus, to clarify the effects of letrozole on the hippocampus and behavior, we examined how chronic administration affects hippocampal neurogenesis and depressive-like behavior in middle-aged, intact female mice. Mice were given either letrozole (1 mg/kg) or vehicle by injection (i.p.) daily for 3 weeks. Depressive-like behavior was assessed during the last 3 days of treatment using the forced swim test, tail suspension test, and sucrose preference test. The production of new neurons was quantified using the immature neuronal marker doublecortin (DCX), and cell proliferation was quantified using the endogenous marker Ki67. We found that letrozole increased DCX and Ki67 expression and maturation in the dentate gyrus, but had no significant effect on depressive-like behavior. Our findings suggest that a reduction in estrogens in middle-aged females increases hippocampal neurogenesis without any adverse impact on depressive-like behavior; as such, this furthers our understanding of how estrogens modulate neurogenesis, and to the rationale for the utilization of letrozole in the clinical management of breast cancer.}

The quinpirole model has been used with rats to replicate compulsive behaviors and study the neurophysiological processes associated with this pathology. Several changes in the dendritic spines of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and dorsolateral striatum (DLS) have been related to the occurrence of compulsive behaviors. Dendritic spines regulate excitatory synaptic contacts, and their morphology is associated with various brain pathologies. The present study was designed to correlate the occurrence of compulsive behaviors (generated by administering the drug quinpirole) with the morphology of the different types of dendritic spines in the mPFC and DLS. A total of 18 male rats were used. Half were assigned to the experimental group, the other half to the control group. The former received injections of quinpirole, while the latter rats were injected with physiological saline solution, for 10 days in both cases. After the experimental treatment, the quinpirole rats exhibited all the parameters indicative of compulsive behavior and a significant correlation with the density of stubby and wide neckless spines in both the mPFC and DLS. Dendritic spines from both mPFC and DLS neurons showed plastic changes correlatively with the expression of compulsive behavior induced by quinpirole. Further studies are suggested to evaluate the involvement of glutamatergic neurotransmission in the neurobiology of OCD.}

abstract = {17β-Estradiol (E2) acts in the brain via genomic and non-genomic mechanisms to influence physiology and behavior. There is seasonal plasticity in the mechanisms by which E2 activates aggression, and non-genomic mechanisms appear to predominate during the non-breeding season. Male song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) display E2-dependent territorial aggression throughout the year. Field studies show that song sparrow aggression during a territorial intrusion is similar in the non-breeding and breeding seasons, but aggression after an intrusion ends differs seasonally. Non-breeding males stop behaving aggressively within minutes whereas breeding males remain aggressive for hours. We hypothesize that this seasonal plasticity in the persistence of aggression relates to seasonal plasticity in E2 signaling. We used a non-invasive route of E2 administration to compare the non-genomic (within 20min) effects of E2 on aggressive behavior in captive non-breeding and breeding season males. E2 rapidly increased barrier contacts (attacks) during an intrusion by 173% in non-breeding season males only. Given that these effects were observed within 20min of E2 administration, they likely occurred via a non-genomic mechanism of action. The present data, taken together with past work, suggest that environmental cues associated with the non-breeding season influence the molecular mechanisms through which E2 influences behavior. In song sparrows, transient expression of aggressive behavior during the non-breeding season is highly adaptive: it minimizes energy expenditure and maximizes the amount of time available for foraging. In all, these data suggest the intriguing possibility that aggression in the non-breeding season may be activated by a non-genomic E2 mechanism due to the fitness benefits associated with rapid and transient expression of aggression.}

abstract = {The present study investigated the hypothesis that social isolation increases aggression by increasing the number of V1a vasopressin receptors in the anterior hypothalamus (AH). Male hamsters were randomly assigned to a group that was allowed to interact with a small nonaggressive hamster three times each week for 3 weeks (socially experienced) or to a group that did not interact socially with other hamsters (social isolates). On the final day of the experiment, hamsters in both groups were placed in a neutral arena with a small, nonaggressive intruder, and agonistic behavior was scored for 10 min. In social isolates, the duration of aggression and the number of attacks were significantly greater than in socially experienced hamsters. There were no significant between-group differences in the latency to the onset of aggression, the number of flank marks or in the duration of defensive/submissive, social or nonsocial behavior. The amount of V1a receptor binding was significantly greater in the AH, the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and the lateral hypothalamus in the social isolates than in the socially experienced hamsters. The amount of V1a receptor binding was significantly greater in the central amygdala of socially experienced hamsters than in socially isolated hamsters. Serum concentrations of testosterone were significantly higher in the socially experienced hamsters than in social isolates. These data support the hypothesis that social isolation increases aggression by increasing the number of V1a vasopressin receptors in the AH.}

abstract = {The European rabbit, both in its wild and domesticated forms, has been a pioneer species in the study of mammalian chemical communication, and illustrates well the difficulty of understanding the functional significance of these often complex signals. Here we investigate the performance of one of the rabbit's most conspicuous chemical signaling behaviors, chin marking (chinning), and the hypothesis that this expresses social dominance. In tests of 21 chinchilla-strain sexually mature males we predicted 1) that animals would show marked and stable individual differences in the frequency of chinning, 2) that these differences would correlate with behaviors associated with dominance such as intrasexual mounting, and 3) that individual differences in the frequency of chinning and dominance-related behaviors would correlate with individual differences in a commonly used physiological indicator of dominance, concentration of serum testosterone. Supporting these predictions and consistent with previous reports, animals showed large and stable individual differences in the frequency of chinning which correlated with the behavioral indicators of dominance and less strongly, with serum testosterone. As our animals had been kept in single cages and without direct contact with other males since weaning, these findings raise the question as to how and when during development such differences among individuals arise. We are currently investigating the possible relation between pups' intrauterine position, postnatal competition among littermates for milk and thermally advantageous positions in the litter huddle, and later differences in indicators of dominance such as those reported here.}

abstract = {The white-throated sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis) represents a powerful model in behavioral neuroendocrinology because it occurs in two plumage morphs that differ with respect to steroid-dependent social behaviors. Birds of the white-striped (WS) morph engage in more territorial aggression than do birds of the tan-striped (TS) morph, and the TS birds engage in more parenting behavior. This behavioral polymorphism is caused by a chromosomal inversion that has captured many genes, including estrogen receptor alpha (ERα). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that morph differences in aggression might be explained by differential sensitivity to estradiol (E2). We administered E2 non-invasively to non-breeding white-throated sparrows and quantified aggression toward a conspecific 10 min later. E2 administration rapidly increased aggression in WS birds but not TS birds, consistent with our hypothesis that differential sensitivity to E2 may at least partially explain morph differences in aggression. To query the site of E2 action in the brain, we administered E2 and quantified Egr-1 expression in brain regions in which expression of ERα is known to differ between the morphs. E2 treatment decreased Egr-1 immunoreactivity in nucleus taeniae of the amygdala, but this effect did not depend on morph. Overall, our results support a role for differential effects of E2 on aggression in the two morphs, but more research will be needed to determine the neuroanatomical site of action.}

abstract = {The JET Real-Time Protection Sequencer (RTPS) co-ordinates responses for magnetic and kinetic actuators to protect the ITER-Like Wall from possible melting events and other undesirable scenarios. It allows programmable stop responses per pulse, based on alarms raised by other systems. The architecture combines a modular run-time application developed using MARTe (Multithreaded Application Real-Time executor) with the top-level JET supervisory and configuration software, Level-1. Operational experience since 2011 drove a requirement to refactor the system in 2017, moving the maximum degree of functionality from compiled code to configuration data, providing more flexibility, maintainability and verifiability of action(s) to be taken during a pulse. This paper discusses the features of the architecture that made this clean separation of rule-based logic and real-time signal processing possible and practical, including how functions and interfaces between MARTe and Level-1 are organised. It also explains management of configuration data to address development, testing, commissioning and operations, each with individual ownership, responsibility and lifecycles. The core technology enabling this is the Level-1 domain specific language, able to manipulate, validate and load into plant configuration parameter sets. The language also enables implementation of advanced user interfaces, providing operators with the tools to focus on essentials tasks for their area of responsibility. It exemplifies this with recent verification and validation of the refactored protection system: unit/low-level integration tests defined by core developers and integration/behavioural tests defined by JET’s Plasma Operations Group, respectively, ensuring robust and consistent behaviour. We show how the wide scope and power of this language has enabled evolution of JET operations efficiently and correctly over decades of operational experience.}

Presently, more and more software-based products and services are available in many different variants to choose from. However, this brings about challenges for the software quality assurance processes. Since only few of all possible variants can be tested at the developer's site, several questions arise. How shall the variability be described in order to make sure that all features are being tested? Is it better to test selected variants on a concrete level, or shall the whole software product line be tested abstractly? What is the quality of a test suite for a product line, anyway? If it is impossible to test all possible variants, which products should be selected for testing? Given a certain product, which test cases are appropriate for it, and given a test case, which products can be tested with it? We address these questions from an empirical software engineering point of view. We sketch modeling formalisms for software product lines. Then, we compare domain-centered and application-centered approaches to software product line testing. We define mutation operators for assessing software product line test suites. Subsequently, we analyze methods for selecting product variants on the basis of a given test suite. Finally, we show how model checking can be used to determine whether a certain test case is applicable for a certain product variant. For all our methods we describe supporting tools and algorithms. Currently, we are integrating these in an integrated tool suite supporting several aspects of model-based testing for software product lines.}

However, the significance and timing of domain-general and homotopic right-hemispheric activation is controversial. We aimed to examine the effect of left-hemispheric lesion location and time post-stroke on right-hemispheric activation. Voxel-based lesion analyses were informed by auditory language-related fMRI activation of 71 patients with left middle cerebral artery stroke examined longitudinally in the acute, subacute and early chronic phase. Language activation was determined in several right-hemispheric regions of interest and served as regressor of interest for voxel-based lesion analyses. We found that an acute to chronic increase of language activation in the right supplementary motor area was associated with lesions to the left extreme capsule as part of the ventral language pathway. Importantly, this activation increase correlated significantly with improvement of out-of-scanner comprehension abilities. We interpret our findings in terms of successful domain-general compensation in patients with critical left frontotemporal disconnection due to damage to the ventral language pathway but relatively spared cortical language areas.}

This review elaborates on the structural diversity of HMOs, encompassing over 200 distinct molecules. These molecules are classified into neutral fucosylated, neutral non-fucosylated, and acidic sialylated types based on their monosaccharide composition and terminal modifications. Furthermore, factors influencing the compositional variation of HMOs are explored, including genetic factors, mode of delivery, geographical and environmental differences, as well as maternal health status. Critically, HMOs can exert a profound impact on neurodevelopment via the “gut-brain axis”. HMOs can modulate the gut microbiota, promoting the proliferation of bifidobacteria, thereby enhancing the integrity of the intestinal barrier and reducing the risk of pathogen invasion, which indirectly protects brain health. Additionally, they directly influence neurotransmitter pathways and the release of neurotrophic factors, facilitating neuronal growth and synaptic plasticity, and thus promoting brain development. Safety assessments confirm that HMOs are suitable for inclusion in infant formula, offering a promising avenue to bridge nutritional gaps in infants when breastfeeding is insufficient.}

The ability of AVP and V1a receptors in the MPOA–AH to regulate flank marking is modulated by a number of factors including galanin (GAL), serotonin (5-HT) and gonadal hormones. More recent studies suggest that there may be seasonal differences in the number or type of AVP receptors in the MPOA–AH controlling flank marking or in the modulation of these mechanisms by GAL or 5-HT. The purpose of the present study was to examine how exposure to “summer-like” and “winter-like” photoperiods alters the neural mechanisms regulating flank marking. These studies confirmed that V1a AVP receptors, but not V1b AVP receptors play a significant role in controlling flank marking in the MPOA–AH in both LP and SP-housed hamsters. These studies also found that there were no significant differences between hamsters housed in LP and SP in the ability of serotonin 5-HT1a/7 and 5-HT1b receptor agonists injected into the MPOA–AH to inhibit odor-induced flank marking. Finally, these studies found that GAL could significantly inhibit the ability of AVP to stimulate flank marking in SP-housed hamsters and that there were no differences between hamsters housed in LP and SP in the ability of a GAL antagonist to inhibit AVP-induced flank marking. The present study confirms that V1a receptors are critical for AVP regulation of flank marking and that photoperiodic mechanisms do not alter the modulation of flank marking by GAL or 5-HT in the MPOA–AH.}

Little is known about the mechanisms of these impairing effects. The current study examined the effects of selective estrogen receptor (ER) α or ERβ activation on DSA performance in middle-aged female rats. Ovariectomized 12month old Long–Evans (LE) rats were treated by subcutaneous injection with the ERα agonist propyl pyrazole triol (PPT) or the ERβ agonist diarylpropionitrile (DPN) at 0.02, 0.08, or 0.20mg/kg/day, or with oil vehicle and tested on an operant variable delay DSA task. A 17β-estradiol group (10% in cholesterol) was included as a positive control group. We replicated our previous finding of a 17β-estradiol induced deficit on DSA performance and this effect was paralleled by low dose (0.02mg/kg/day) DPN treatment. Higher doses of DPN failed to produce a significant change in performance. The highest dose of PPT (0.20mg/kg/day) also impaired performance, but this effect was subtle and limited to the longest delay during the final block of testing. These data confirm our earlier findings that chronic 17β-estradiol treatment has an impairing effect on the DSA task, and suggest that ERβ activation may underlie the deficit.}

Testosterone (T) controls a large suite of male-typical behaviors and morphological characteristics. High T concentrations may be energetically costly or even detrimental to survival; thus, preventing lower quality males from falsely advertising their fitness. Three preference studies were conducted to examine if females use T-dependent cues to assess potential mates. For Experiment 1, females were given a choice between a pair of morphologically similar males, bucks (intact males) and stags (post-pubertally castrated males), during the breeding and non-breeding seasons. In both seasons, females preferred the bucks compared to stags. In Experiment 2, females were given a choice between bucks, stags and wethers (pre-pubertally castrated males) during the non-breeding season. For some comparisons, castrated males received 25mg testosterone propionate (TP) or were untreated. Females preferred TP-treated males compared to untreated males and showed no preference when given a choice between either two TP-treated or two untreated males. In Experiment 3, females were given a choice between a pair of bucks and a pair of stags treated with 25mg TP during monthly tests in the breeding season. At each monthly test, females preferred the males with higher T concentrations near the time of the behavior test. These studies suggest that females use T-dependent cues to assess potential mates, and T concentrations may indicate a male's overall fitness.}

However, chronological age predicted the size of interference and conflict effects for monolingual speakers only. We also observed a more widespread pattern of bilateral aging-effcts in brain regions that are classically associated with aging in monolingual speakers compared to bilingual speakers. Notably, GMV in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and the level of daily exposure to a second language (L2) independently predict performance on the ANT in bilingual speakers. We conclude that regular (daily) bilingual experience mitigates the typical effects of aging on cognitive control at the behavioral and the neural level.}

Cognitive performance, mood, and symptoms of dehydration were assessed during each experiment, 3 times at rest and during each of 3 exercise sessions. The DN and DD trials in which a volunteer attained a ≥1% level of dehydration were pooled and compared to that volunteer's equivalent EU trials. Mean dehydration achieved during these DN and DD trials was −1.36 ± 0.16% of body mass. Significant adverse effects of dehydration were present at rest and during exercise for vigor-activity, fatigue-inertia, and total mood disturbance scores of the Profile of Mood States and for task difficulty, concentration, and headache as assessed by questionnaire. Most aspects of cognitive performance were not affected by dehydration. Serum osmolality, a marker of hydration, was greater in the mean of the dehydrated trials in which a ≥1% level of dehydration was achieved (P = 0.006) compared to EU. In conclusion, degraded mood, increased perception of task difficulty, lower concentration, and headache symptoms resulted from 1.36% dehydration in females. Increased emphasis on optimal hydration is warranted, especially during and after moderate exercise.}

abstract = {In birds, corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) binds corticosterone, progesterone and testosterone. The concentration of each ligand can alter the binding of the other ligands through competitive interactions. Thus, an increase in corticosterone or progesterone may displace testosterone bound to CBG, leading to an increase in bioactive free testosterone levels without affecting total testosterone levels in the circulation. Aggressive interactions increase plasma total testosterone levels in some birds but not in others. Here, we tested the hypothesis that aggressive encounters in the late breeding season would not increase total testosterone levels in plasma, but would alter CBG, total corticosterone or total progesterone levels in such a way as to modify the number of available binding sites and therefore occupancy by testosterone. A marked decrease in CBG occupancy by testosterone would indirectly suggest an increase in free testosterone levels in plasma. Wild male white-crowned sparrows were exposed to a simulated territorial intrusion (STI) or control for 30 min. Subjects were then caught and bled. We measured CBG using a ligand-binding assay and corticosterone, progesterone and testosterone using highly sensitive radioimmunoassays. STI significantly increased aggressive behaviors but did not affect plasma total testosterone levels. STI significantly increased plasma CBG and total corticosterone levels and decreased plasma total progesterone levels. We predict that CBG occupancy by corticosterone will increase slightly following an aggressive encounter. However, this small change is unlikely to increase free testosterone levels, because of the large number of seemingly unoccupied CBG binding sites in these subjects.}

abstract = {Men are typically reported to have higher pain thresholds than women. Gonadal hormones, particularly testosterone for males, may contribute to this effect. This study tested whether changes in the male hormonal milieu early or late in development alter the inflammatory pain induced by carrageenan (CARR, 3%, intraarticular). Male rats were either gonadectomized or sham gonadectomized neonatally. Once adults, the same rats underwent either sham surgery or gonadectomy, and received a testosterone or oil implant. After baseline testing two weeks later, animals were tested in response to mechanical and thermal stimulation following CARR-induced inflammation and injection of saline, 1 mg/kg, or 5 mg/kg morphine. Hormone alterations did not affect baseline responses, but CARR induced mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia in the injured limb. Gonadectomy in adult males injected with saline enhanced inflammation-induced sensitivity to mechanical but not thermal stimulation and the effect was reversed by testosterone. After inflammation, saline-treated males gonadectomized neonatally displayed lower mechanical threshold than control sham animals but this effect was not reversed by testosterone. Both doses of morphine increased mechanical and thermal thresholds. However, compared with the control group, 1 mg/kg morphine was equally effective in reducing mechanical hyperalgesia among groups of animals gonadectomized as adults, but less effective in males gonadectomized neonatally. The results suggest that in males: 1. the antihyperalgesic effect of testosterone (or its metabolites) in CARR-induced inflammation is established during development and maintained by circulating levels of testosterone in adulthood; 2. the nociception-related interaction between the opioid and gonadal systems influences the sensitivity to mechanical stimuli and is likely established during the period of sexual differentiation.}

The interviews were analyzed qualitatively, and quantification of the analysis results is presented. We first create an overview of software engineering in the heavy-duty mobile machinery industry. We then identify problem areas affecting software development and discuss some of the possible solutions found in literature. Our findings indicate that the major problem areas faced in the industry that require more research are its digital transformation, autonomous machine functional safety, low availability of workforce for developing software for robotic mobile machines and the lack of established software standards.}

We used an animal model of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to assess long-term behavioral effects of a single dose of NPS, microinjected into the basolateral amygdala (BLA) 1h following exposure to predator-scent stress (PSS). To elucidate the molecular mechanism by which NPS attenuates behavioral stress responses, expression levels of neuropeptide Y (NPY), NPY-Y1 receptor (NPY-Y1R), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were evaluated in the hippocampus. The behavioral and molecular effects of NPS receptor antagonist (NPS-RA), NPY-Y1R antagonist (NPY-Y1RA), or both administered centrally were evaluated in the same manner. Circulating corticosterone levels were measured at different time points following PSS-exposure. Immediate post-exposure treatment with NPS had a marked protective effect; BLA microinfusion of NPS completely abolished the extreme behavioral response to PSS, restored the decreased expression of BDNF and, unexpectedly, PY-Y1R, but didn't affect the decreased expression of NPY. BLA microinfusion of both NPY-Y1RA and NPS-RA together had an additive effect, which completely prevented the anxiolytic effects of NPS in rats exposed to PSS and disrupted the expression of NPY-Y1R in the hippocampus following NPS infusion. It may therefore be hypothesized that NPS acts, directly or indirectly, on both the NPY-Y1R and NPS receptors and that the cross-talk between NPS and NPY-Y1R may be necessary for the anxiolytic effects of NPS post-exposure. The NPS system might thus contribute to a potential endogenous mechanism underlying the shift towards adaptive behavioral response and thereby might be relevant as a pharmacological target for attenuating stress-related sequelae.}

The aim of the current study was to explore how estradiol-treated rats respond to acute and chronic stress compared to ovariectomized rats. Ovariectomized rats received vehicle or 17β-estradiol injections (10μg/250g) once every 4 days, which induced alternating high and low plasma 17β-estradiol levels. Stress was presented by daily exposure to an adverse environment in which the animals received five footshocks for either 3 or 22 days. Under control conditions no differences were observed, but as soon as stress was applied, reactions of ovariectomized and estradiol-treated rats diverged. Both acute and chronic stress increased the c-Fos protein expression in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. Cyclic estradiol treatment reduced this stress-induced activation of the PVN, an effect that seems to be dependent on the plasma estradiol levels. No differences in stress-induced corticosterone responses were revealed between the treatment groups. An increase in the number of ERβ-expressing cells in the PVN of ovariectomized and estradiol-treated rats during chronic stress implied increased ERβ-mediated mechanisms during these conditions. The dampening effect of estradiol on the excessive stress-induced activity in the PVN may be beneficial for the animal in its response to chronic recurrent stress by reducing the output of the PVN.}

The cribbers and weavers in the study had been known to show stereotypic behaviour for at least 12 months prior to commencement of the study. Switching to a high grain diet reduced explorative behaviour (P<0.01) but did not affect stereotypic behaviour. Horses took more time to consume the entire high grain ration than the moderate grain ration (P<0.01), possibly in an attempt to slow the rate of starch delivery to the hindgut. The high grain diet had lower digestibility than the moderate grain diet (P<0.01). Switching to a high grain diet was accompanied by a reduction in water intake (P<0.05), though the two diets did not differ significantly in their effects on plasma cortisol concentration, heart rate, or OCCT. Combined, these findings suggest that horses may have altered their feeding habits in response to the change in diet and this change in behaviour could have been an attempt to limit diet-induced acid build-up in the hindgut. Future studies on the relationship between the level of grain in the diet and stereotypic behaviour should consider that horses may show feeding changes to different diets which attenuate diet-induced effects on physiology and other behaviour.}

Pulsatility of glucocorticoids has been determined to be critical for optimal transcriptional, neuroendocrine, and behavioral responses. We used an animal model of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to assess whether stress-induced impairment of behavioral responses is correlated with aberrant secretion of corticosterone. Serial blood samples were collected manually via the jugular vein cannula during the light-(inactive)-phase in conscious male rats at 20-min intervals for a period of 5 h before and 6.5 h after exposure to predator scent stress. The outcome measures included behavior in an elevated plus-maze and acoustic startle response 7 days after exposure. Individual animals were retrospectively classified as having “extreme”, “partial”, or “minimal” behavioral responses according to pre-set cut-off criteria for behavioral response patterns. Corticosterone secretion patterns were analyzed retrospectively. Under basal conditions, the amplitude of ultradian oscillations of corticosterone levels, rather than the mean corticosterone level or the frequency of corticosterone pulsatility, was significantly reduced in individuals who displayed PTSD-phenotype 8 days later. In addition, extreme disruption of behavior on day 8 post-exposure was also characterized by a blunting of corticosterone response to the stressor. Animals with behavior that was only partially affected or unaffected displayed none of the above changes. Blunted basal corticosterone pulse amplitude is a pre-existing susceptibility or risk factor for PTSD, which originates from prior (life) experiences and may therefore predict post-exposure PTSD-phenotype in rats.}

The usefulness of the proposed approach is illustrated by formulating and testing a generalization of the standard neoclassical investment function (SNC). The generalized investment function is shown to include six disequilibrium hypotheses omitted from the SNC and to better fit quarterly data for capital appropriations in durable and nondurable manufacturing industries. Model-behavior tests showing the importance of the six hypotheses are also summarized.}

Behavioral and ERP studies suggest that detection of sequential probabilities (statistical learning) plays an important role in the process of word segmentation. To identify the brain regions that are engaged during statistical segmentation of tone sequences, we measured changes in blood oxygenation using multichannel near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) while participants were exposed to continuous, nonlinguistic auditory sequences, the elements of which were organized into fixed “tone-words,” but sequenced in random order. We habituated the participants to the tone-words by presenting the stimuli in a training phase prior to the presentation of the continuous tone sequences. After training, the statistical sequences, which included six tone-words, and the random sequences, which included 11 tones in random order, were presented alternately during NIRS recording. A large increase in the oxygenated hemoglobin concentration was observed in the left inferior frontal cortex (IFC) during the statistical sequence condition, but not during the random sequence condition. This suggests that the left IFC plays an important role in statistical segmentation of tone sequences, during which participants deploy the knowledge obtained in the training phase on the subsequent continuous sequence.}

Animals were treated with permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by an 18 day CUMS procedure. Proliferating cells in the hippocampus and their cell fate were investigated on days 19 and 28 after ischemic surgery. Additionally, expression of the Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD) and its downstream targets Hes1 and Hes5 was examined. A sucrose preference test and forced swim test were used to assess behavioral responses. CUMS produced depressive-like behaviors and decreased the number of proliferating cells on day 19 (both p<0.001), accompanied by a decreased expression of both Hes1 and Hes5 in the hippocampus of ischemic animals (p<0.001). On day 28, CUMS resulted in a decreased number of neurogenically-differentiating cells in the subgranular zone (p<0.001) while permitting differentiation into astrocytes in the hilus (p<0.05). Hes1 and Hes5 protein expression levels were increased. The expression of the NICD was significantly decreased at both time-points. CUMS led to expression changes in the Notch1 signaling cascade in ischemic rats, most of which concerned hippocampal neurogenesis. This suggests that variation in Notch1 activity and subsequent expression of its downstream targets, including Hes1 and Hes5, may, at least in part, contribute to modulation of ischemia-related hippocampal neurogenesis by CUMS.}

In a series of experiments, we tested how injections of testosterone influenced the spatial working and reference memory of castrated male rats. In the eight-arm radial maze, testosterone injections (0.500mg/rat) reduced the number of working memory errors during the early blocks of testing but had no effect on the number of reference memory errors relative to the castrated control group. In a reference memory version of the Morris water maze, injections of a wide range of testosterone doses (0.0625–1.000mg/rat) reduced path lengths to the hidden platform, indicative of improved spatial learning. This improved learning was independent of testosterone dose, with all treatment groups showing better performance than the castrated control males. Furthermore, this effect was only observed when rats were given testosterone injections starting 7days prior to water maze testing and not when injections were given only on the testing days. We also observed that certain doses of testosterone (0.250 and 1.000mg/rat) increased perseverative behavior in a reversal-learning task. Finally, testosterone did not have a clear effect on spatial working memory in the Morris water maze, although intermediate doses seemed to optimize performance. Overall, the results indicate that testosterone can have positive activational effects on spatial learning and memory, but the duration of testosterone replacement and the nature of the spatial task modify these effects.}

abstract = {In rodent species, the expression of reproductive behavior relies heavily on the perception of social odors, as well as the presence of circulating steroid hormones. In the Syrian hamster, chemosensory and hormonal cues are processed within an interconnected network of ventral forebrain nuclei that regulates many aspects of social behavior. Within this network, the posteromedial cortical amygdala (PMCo) receives direct projections from the accessory olfactory bulbs and contains a dense population of steroid receptor-containing neurons. Consequently, the PMCo may be important for generating odor-guided aspects of reproductive behavior, yet little is known regarding the role of this nucleus in regulating these behaviors. Thus, the present study tested male hamsters with site-specific electrolytic lesions of the PMCo for their (a) sexual odor preference in a Y-maze apparatus, (b) sexual odor discrimination in a habituation-dishabituation task, and (c) copulatory behavior when paired with a sexually receptive female. PMCo-lesioned males preferred to investigate female odors over male odors and were able to discriminate between these odor sources. However, PMCo lesions were associated with several alterations in the male copulatory pattern. First, PMCo-lesioned males displayed increased investigation of the female's non-anogenital region, suggesting that the PMCo may be involved in directing appropriate chemosensory investigation during mating. Second, PMCo lesions altered the temporal pattern of the mating sequence, as PMCo-lesioned males took longer than Sham-lesioned males to reach sexual satiety, as indicated by the delayed expression of long intromissions. This delayed onset of satiety was associated with an increased number of ejaculations compared with Sham-lesioned males. Importantly, these data provide the first direct evidence for a functional role of the PMCo in regulating male reproductive behavior.}

Following social defeat, male hamsters no longer display normal territorial aggression but instead display submissive/defensive behavior in the presence of a smaller opponent, a phenomenon we have termed conditioned defeat (CD). The purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of gonadal hormones on the display of CD in male hamsters. In Experiment 1, males were castrated or sham-operated. The castrated males were significantly more submissive following social defeat relative to their intact counterparts. The increased submissive behavior in the castrated males during CD testing was particularly surprising, given the fact that they were attacked significantly less during CD training. In Experiment 2a, males were castrated and given hormone replacement. Castrated males treated with testosterone or dihydrotestosterone displayed significantly less submissive behavior following social defeat than did those treated with cholesterol or estradiol. Finally, in Experiment 2b, there was no effect of hormone replacement on aggressive behavior in non-defeated hamsters suggesting that the decrease in submissive behavior in males treated with dihydrotestosterone or testosterone is specific to being previously defeated. Taken together the data indicate that the presence of androgens reduces the display of submission in defeated male hamsters. More importantly, these findings suggest that androgens may have a protective effect against the development of depression-like or anxiety-like behaviors following exposure to an ethologically relevant stressor.}

However, there are scarce tools and methods supporting their Validation and Verification (V&V), which are essential activities for the proper engineering of meta-models. In order to fill this gap, we propose two complementary meta-model V&V languages. The first one has similar philosophy to the xUnit framework, as it enables the definition of meta-model unit test suites comprising model fragments and assertions on their (in-)correctness. The second one is directed to express and verify expected properties of a meta-model, including domain and design properties, quality criteria and platform-specific requirements. As a proof of concept, we have developed tooling for both languages in the Eclipse platform, and illustrate its use within an example-driven approach for meta-model construction. The expressiveness of our languages is demonstrated by their application to build a library of meta-model quality issues, which has been evaluated over the ATL zoo of meta-models and some OMG specifications. The results show that integrated support for meta-model V&V (as the one we propose here) is urgently needed in meta-modelling environments.}

Administration of andrographolide significantly decreased the mounting latency at 120 and 180min and increased mounting frequency at 180min after treatment. In endothelium-intact rat aortic strips, norepineprine-induced contraction was reduced by preincubation with andrographolide. Administration of 50mg/kg andrographolide orally to male mice once daily for 2, 4, 6 or 8weeks had no significant effects on sperm morphology and motility. Interestingly, at week 4, serum testosterone level in mice treated with andrographolide was significantly increased when compared to the control. Thus, the effects of andrographolide on vascular response to norepinephrine and testosterone level observed in this study might be contributed to the sexual enhancing properties observed.}

We examined effects of age and sexual experience on serum hormones (total testosterone, free testosterone, estradiol, LH) and on numbers of androgen receptor (AR) and estrogen receptor α (ERα) immunoreactive cells in the hypothalamus. Extensive sexual experience was given to male rats at 4 months of age. Rats were euthanized at either 4 months (young) or 12 months (middle-aged (MA)). Comparable sexually naïve male rats were handled and placed into the testing arena but did not receive any sexual experience. Thus, we had four groups: young-naïve, young-experienced, MA-naïve and MA-experienced. Serum hormone levels were assayed, and numbers of AR and ERα cells were quantified stereologically in the medial preoptic nucleus (MPN) and the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV). Sexually experienced males had significantly elevated serum testosterone and free testosterone in both age groups. Both total and free testosterone were higher, and estradiol lower, in middle-aged than young rats. Experience did not alter either AR or ERα expression in the preoptic brain regions studied. Aging was associated with increased expression of AR, but no change in ERα. These results show that sexual experience can induce short-term and long-term alterations in serum hormones but these effects are not manifested upon their receptors in the hypothalamus.}

Serum levels of reproductive hormones were obtained for all subjects; APOE-ε4 haplotype was determined for 77 women. National Adult Reading Test and Odor Memory/Discrimination Test scores were positively influenced by HRT. Odor Identification and Odor Memory/Discrimination Test scores were lower for women who scored poorly on a delayed recall test, a surrogate for mild cognitive impairment. The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Revised, as a Neuropsychological Instrument Spatial Span Backwards Test scores were higher in women receiving estrogen and progestin HRT and directly correlated with serum testosterone levels, the latter implying a positive effect of testosterone on spatial memory. APOE-ε4 was associated with poorer odor threshold test scores. These data suggest that HRT positively influences a limited number of olfactory and cognitive measures during menopause.}

Quantitative assessment of the effects of exposure to juvenile stress was made 1 month post-stress, and obtained by measuring: emotional (utilizing an open field and a startle response tests) and cognitive (Morris water-maze task) functions, as well as neurosteroids concentration (DHEA and its sulfate ester, DHEAS) in the hypothalamus and entorhinal cortex. We report here that an exposure to juvenile stress led to elevated levels of anxiety 1 month post-stress. Moreover, in a spatial learning task, the juvenile stress group performed poorer than the control group. Finally, an exposure to juvenile stress increased DHEAS but not DHEA concentrations both in the hypothalamus and the entorhinal cortex. These findings indicate that an exposure to juvenile stress has long-lasting effects on behavior and DHEAS levels in the hypothalamus and the entorhinal cortex. These effects may be of relevance to our understanding of early life stress-related disorders such as PTSD and major depression.}

Whereas males exhibit a prolonged behavioral response to defeat (i.e., conditioned defeat), many females remain aggressive or show only a transient submissive response following defeat. The current study tested the hypothesis that sex steroids underlie this differential behavioral responsivity to social defeat. Female hamsters were ovariectomized and implanted with Silastic capsules containing estradiol (E2), testosterone (T), progesterone (P), dihydrotestosterone (DHT), or a blank capsule (no hormone replacement). After a 3-week recovery period, each subject was placed inside the home cage of a larger, more aggressive female for four 5-min defeat trials. The following day, each animal was tested for conditioned defeat by testing it in its own home cage in the presence of a smaller, non-aggressive intruder. Submissive, aggressive, social, and nonsocial behaviors were subsequently scored. Hamsters receiving E2 or T displayed significantly lower levels of submissive behavior than did animals receiving P, DHT, or no hormone replacement. There were no significant differences in aggressive behavior among groups. These data suggest that gonadal hormones can influence submissive behavior in female hamsters. Collectively, these results suggest that the sex differences observed in conditioned defeat may, in part, be explained by sex differences in circulating gonadal hormones.}

Androgens play an essential role in the development, growth, and maintenance of male sex organs, as well as the musculoskeletal and central nervous systems. Yet with advancing age, androgens can drive the onset of prostate cancer, the second leading cause of cancer death in males within the United States. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) by pharmacologic and/or surgical castration induces apoptosis of prostate cells and subsequent shrinkage of the prostate and prostate tumors. However, ADT is associated with significant musculoskeletal and behavioral adverse effects. The unique pharmacological activity of selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) MK-4541 recently has been reported as an AR antagonist with 5α-reductase inhibitor function. The molecule inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in AR positive, androgen dependent prostate cancer cells. Importantly, MK-4541 inhibited androgen-dependent prostate growth in male rats yet maintained lean body mass and bone formation following ovariectomy in female rats. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of SARM MK-4541 in the androgen-dependent Dunning R3327-G prostate carcinoma xenograft mouse model as well as on skeletal muscle mass and function, and AR-regulated behavior in mice. MK-4541 significantly inhibited the growth of R3327-G prostate tumors, exhibited anti-androgen effects on the seminal vesicles, reduced plasma testosterone concentrations in intact males, and inhibited Ki67 expression. MK-4541 treated xenografts appeared similar to xenografts in castrated mice. Importantly, we demonstrate that MK-4541 exhibited anabolic activity in androgen deficient conditions, increasing lean body mass and muscle function in adult castrated mice. Moreover, MK-4541 treatment restored general activity levels in castrated mice. Thus, MK-4541 exhibits an optimum profile as an adjuvant therapy to ADT which may provide potent anti-androgenic activity at the prostate yet protective activity on skeletal muscle and behavior in patients.}

abstract = {Summary
Early-life stress produces a cascade of neurobiological events that cause enduring changes in neural plasticity and synaptic efficacy that appear to play pivotal roles in the pathophysiology of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been implicated in the neurobiological mechanisms of these changes, in interaction with components of the stress response, such as corticosterone. This study examined the consequences of juvenile stress for behavior during adulthood in association with circulating corticosterone levels and BDNF expression. The experiments examined single exposure to predator scent stress (soiled cat litter for 10min) as compared to repeated exposure, early in life and later on. Behavioral responses were assessed in the elevated plus maze and the acoustic startle response paradigms at 28, 60 and 90 days of age. Plasma corticosterone was measured and brain areas analyzed for BDNF levels. The results show that juvenile stress exposure increased anxiety-like behavior and startle amplitude and decreased plasma corticosterone. This response was seen immediately after exposure and also long term. Adult stress exposure increased anxiety-like behavior, startle amplitude and plasma corticosterone. Exposure to both early and later life trauma elicited reduced levels of corticosterone following the initial exposure, which were not raised by re-exposure, and elicited significant downregulation of BDNF mRNA and protein levels in the hippocampus CA1 subregion. The consequences of adult stress exposure were more severe in rats were exposed to the same stressor as juveniles, indicated increased vulnerability. The results suggest that juvenile stress has resounding effects in adulthood reflected in behavioral responses. The concomitant changes in BDNF and corticosterone levels may mediate the changes in neural plasticity and synaptic functioning underlying clinical manifestations of PTSD.}

Fasting activates expression of orexigenic peptides from the arcuate nucleus, increases corticosterone while reduces leptin, and pro-TRH mRNA levels despite low serum thyroid hormone concentration (tertiary hypothyroidism). TRH synthesis is positively regulated by anorexigenic peptides whose expression is reduced in fasting. The model of dehydration-induced anorexia (DIA) leads to decreased voluntary food intake but peptide expression in the arcuate is similar to forced-food restriction (FFR), where animals remain hungered. We compared the response of HPT axis of female Wistar rats submitted to DIA (2.5% saline solution, food ad libitum, 7 days) with FFR (provided with the amount of food ingested by DIA) and naïve (N) group fed ad libitum, as well as their response to acute cold exposure. Pro-TRH and pro-CRH mRNA levels in the PVN were measured by RT-PCR, TRH content, serum concentration of TSH and thyroid hormones by radioimmunoassay. DIA rats reduced 80% their food consumption compared to N, decreased PVN pro-CRH expression, serum estradiol and leptin levels, increased corticosterone similar to FFR. HPT axis of DIA animals failed to adapt: FFR presented tertiary hypothyroidism and DIA, primary. Response to cold stimulation leading to increased pro-TRH mRNA levels and TRH release was preserved under reduced energy availability in FFR rats but not in DIA, although the dynamics of hormonal release differed: TSH release augmented only in naïve; thyroxine in all but highest in DIA, and triiodothyronine in FFR and DIA suggesting a differential regulation of deiodinases.}

These ambiguous findings may be due to differential actions of ovarian steroids on anxiety versus fear. To investigate such a role, we used the open field test (OFT) and fear-potentiated startle (FPS). We examined these behaviors between cycling female rats in proestrus (high E and rising P) or diestrus (low E and P), as well as between ovariectomized rats treated for 2 weeks with placebo, E, or E plus P (OVX, OVX/E, OVX/EP, respectively). We found no differences in anxiety-like or fear behaviors in OFT or FPS between proestrus and diestrus rats, perhaps due to the opposing effects of E and P. In contrast, we found that the OVX/E rats spent more time in the center of the OFT compared to the OVX and OVX/EP rats with no difference in overall activity level, suggesting that E reduced anxiety and this was opposed by P. With FPS, the OVX/E rats showed increased startle in the first third of the testing session, followed by a rapid decline in startle magnitude in subsequent trials. The addition of P to E treatment counteracted this effect. In conclusion, E may have differential effects on specific components of anxiety and fear; E may decrease anxiety in a naturalistic environment, but intensify both fear learning and extinction processes. P antagonizes these E effects on anxiety and fear.}

abstract = {In Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus), the expression of reproductive behavior requires the perception and discrimination of sexual odors. The behavioral response to these odors is mediated by a network of ventral forebrain nuclei, including the medial preoptic area (MPOA). The role of MPOA in male copulatory behavior has been well-studied, but less is known about the role of MPOA in appetitive aspects of male reproductive behavior. Furthermore, many previous studies that examined the role of MPOA in reproductive behavior have used large lesions that damaged other nuclei near MPOA or fibers of passage within MPOA, making it difficult to attribute post-lesion deficits in reproductive behavior to MPOA specifically. Thus, the current study used discrete, excitotoxic lesions of MPOA to test the role of this nucleus in opposite-sex odor preference and copulatory behavior in both sexually-naïve and sexually-experienced males. Lesions of MPOA eliminated preference for volatile, opposite-sex odors in sexually-naïve, but not sexually-experienced, males. When males were allowed to contact the sexual odors, however, preference for female odors remained intact. Surprisingly, lesions of MPOA caused severe copulatory deficits only in sexually-naïve males, suggesting previous reports of copulatory deficits following MPOA lesions in sexually-experienced males were not due to damage to MPOA itself. Together, these results demonstrate that the role of MPOA in appetitive and consummatory aspects of reproductive behavior varies with the volatility of the sexual odors and the sexual experience of the male.}

Early identification and effective management of hearing loss aims to optimize auditory plasticity for auditory potential through life, by making sound audible from the first months of life through hearing aids. For infants with profound hearing loss or auditory neuropathy the option of cochlear implantation may give improved hearing for speech, typically at around 12 months of age. The onus of responsibility for using hearing aids and providing a suitable sound environment for the child falls on the parents, thus requiring a family-centred model of audiology management rather than the traditional expert- or medical-models of intervention. For later-onset hearing loss, particularly conductive hearing loss secondary to otitis media or other middle-ear conditions, there is no longer a national screening programme, but instead a greater reliance on surveillance. Many school-entry screens of hearing have been disbanded and there is risk of children with later-onset hearing loss being overlooked despite the recognized secondary effects of untreated hearing loss on speech development, social interaction and subsequent educational achievement.}

Accumulating evidence demonstrates that exercise increases endogenous neurogenesis and may even protect against central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Here, we explored the effects of lack of exercise on neurogenesis in rats by employing a routine hindlimb suspension (HS) model over a 2-week period, which consists of elevating their tails, thereby raising their hindlimbs above the ground and unloading the weights in these extremities. In addition, the effects of exercise and recovery time with normal caging after HS were also explored. BrdU (50 mg/kg, i.p.) was injected every 8 h over the last 4 days of each paradigm to label proliferative cells. Immunohistochemical results revealed that HS significantly reduced the number of BrdU/Doublecortin double-positive cells in the subventricular zone and dentate gyrus. Exercise and recovery time significantly improved atrophy of the soleus muscle, but did not attenuate the HS-induced decrement in BrdU/Dcx-positive cells. A separate cohort of animals was exposed to the same HS paradigm and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of neurotrophic factors was performed on brain tissue samples harvested at the end of the HS period, as well as plasma samples from all animals. ELISA results revealed that HS reduced the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the hippocampus and vascular endothelial growth factor plasma levels. This study revealed that lack of exercise reduced neurogenesis with downregulation of neurotrophic factors. The use of the HS model in conjunction with CNS disease models should further elucidate the role of exercise in neurogenesis and neurotrophic factors in neurologic disorders.}

A cascade of neuroendocrine events regulates the initiation and progression of female puberty. However, the factors that determine the timing of these events across individuals are still uncertain. While the consequences of puberty on subsequent emotional development and adult behavior have received significant attention, what is less understood are the social and environmental factors that actually alter the initiation and progression of puberty. In order to more fully understand what factors influence pubertal timing in females, the present study quantified social and emotional behavior; stress physiology; and growth and activity measures in juvenile female rhesus monkeys to determine what best predicts eventual puberty. Based on previous reports, we hypothesized that increased agonistic behavior resulting from subordinate status in their natal group, in combination with slowed growth, reduced prosocial behavior, and increased emotional reactivity would predict delayed puberty. The analyses were restricted to behavioral and physiological measures obtained prior to the onset of puberty, defined as menarche. Together, our findings indicate that higher rates of aggression but lower rates of submission received from group mates; slower weight gain; and greater emotional reactivity, evidenced by higher anxiety, distress and appeasing behaviors, and lower cortisol responsivity in response to a potentially threatening situation, predicts delayed puberty. Together the combination of these variables accounted for 58% of the variance in the age of menarche, 71% in age at first ovulation, and 45% in the duration of adolescent sterility. While early puberty may be more advantageous for the individual from a fertility standpoint, it presents significant health risks, including increased risk for a number of estrogen dependent cancers and as well as the emergence of mood disorders during adulthood. On the other hand, it is possible that increased emotional reactivity associated with delayed puberty could persist, increasing the risk for emotional dysregulation to socially challenging situations. The data argue for prospective studies that will determine how emotional reactivity shown to be important for pubertal timing is affected by early social experience and temperament, and how these stress-related variables contribute to body weight accumulation, affecting the neuroendocrine regulation of puberty.}

abstract = {Recent findings from our laboratory and others indicate that exposure to stress can increase expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1). In a series of studies examining this response, we observed pronounced differences in baseline levels of hypothalamic IL-1 of pair-housed rats. We hypothesized that these pair-wise differences might be a result of prolonged social stress associated with dominance/submissiveness, and that the submissive animal would show heightened baseline levels of IL-1. In order to test this hypothesis, we utilized a food competition paradigm (access to cheerios) to assess dominance within a dyad prior to the assessment of hypothalamic IL-1 levels. Based on the results of this test, clear dominance hierarchies were observed in ∼50% of the dyads, a ratio comparable to what has been reported previously. More importantly, this dominant/submissive categorization could be used to predict pair-wise differences in hypothalamic IL-1 with greater than 90% accuracy. Specifically, the submissive rat in each dyad (determined a priori) consistently evinced hypothalamic IL-1 levels that were nearly double that of its dominant cage mate. Further studies demonstrated that submissive rats showed a more rapid and pronounced hyperthermic response to novel environment stress relative to dominant rats. Interestingly, social status had no effect on corticosterone reactivity, even when the nature and intensity of the stressor was varied. Finally, maintenance of a clear dominance hierarchy obfuscated hypothalamic IL-1 responses to footshock exposure, with the most robust increases in hypothalamic IL-1 provoked by footshock being observed in pairs where there was no clear dominance hierarchy. Together, these findings suggest that social status can have a significant impact on stress reactivity and neuroimmune consequences of stressor exposure even in the unperturbed home cage environment.}

A prospective animal model for posttraumatic stress disorder was employed to assess the behavioral effects of a single dose of Δ9-THC administered intraperitoneally following exposure to psychogenic stress. Animals were exposed to predator scent stress and treated 1h later with Δ9-THC (1, 5 and 10mg/kg) or vehicle. The outcome measures included behavior in an elevated plus-maze and acoustic startle response 1, 6 and 24h or 7days after exposure and freezing behavior upon exposure to a trauma cue on day 8. Pre-set cut-off behavioral criteria classified exposed animals as those with “extreme,” “minimal” or “intermediate” (partial) response. Circulating corticosterone levels were assessed over 2h after exposure with and without Δ9-THC. The behavioral effects of a CB1 antagonist (AM251) administered systemically 1h post exposure were evaluated. In the short term (1–6h), 5mg/kg of Δ9-THC effectively attenuated anxiety-like behaviors. In the longer-term (7days), it showed no effect in attenuating PTSD-like behavioral stress responses, or freezing response to trauma cue. Δ9-THC significantly decreased corticosterone levels. In contrast, administration of AM251 (a CB1 antagonist/inverse agonist) 1h post exposure attenuated long-term behavioral stress responses through activation of the HPA-axis. The demonstrated lack of preventive efficacy of early Δ9-THC treatment and reports of its anxiogenic effects in many individuals raises doubts not only regarding its potential clinical value, but also the advisability of clinical trials. The endocannabinoids exert complex effects on behavioral responses mediating glucocorticoid effects on memory of traumatic experiences.}

In addition, the level of maternal behaviour expressed by mothers is correlated with the concentration of hormones during the peripartum period. Therefore, we investigated whether the selection for temperament had resulted in hormonal differences between the two lines with regard to the hormones that could be involved in the onset of maternal behaviour. Oestradiol, progesterone and cortisol concentrations from 4 days before parturition to 24 h after parturition were determined from blood samples collected from 10 calm and 12 nervous ewes. Behavioural interactions between ewe and lamb were also recorded for 2 h starting at parturition. Mothers of both temperament lines showed adequate maternal behaviour under the controlled conditions of the study. Therefore, the results of the study do not suggest that selection for a calm or nervous temperament has profoundly affected the intrinsic ability of mothers to display adequate maternal behaviour. Hormonal differences between the two temperament lines were generally small and their possible influence on the display of maternal behaviour in the two temperament lines would have to be demonstrated.}

We found that CP had no robust effects on anxiety or in recognition memory. In the water maze, only a slight decreased percentage of failed trials in the reference memory task and an improvement in an indirect index of attention were observed. However, we detected an up-regulation of hippocampal PSA-NCAM expression, only in CP-males, although this effect was not related to changes in LTP. No hormonal alterations were evident.

The “depressive-like” strain was the Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL), compared to their controls, Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats. Prepubertal FSL rats showed abnormal levels of only a few monoamines and their metabolites in these brain regions. This is in contrast to former studies, in which adult FSL rats exhibited significantly higher levels of all the monoamines and their metabolites measured. These different abnormal monoamine patterns between the “depressed” prepubertal rats and their adults, may help to explain why depressed children and adolescents fail to respond to antidepressant treatment as well as adults do. On the other hand, FSL prepubertal rats exhibited the same pattern of abnormal DHEA basal levels as was found in adults in previous experiments. The results from the current study may imply that treatment with DHEA could be a promising novel therapeutic option for depressed children and adolescents that fail to respond to common (monoaminergic) antidepressant treatments.}

In Experiment 1, 20 adult male hamsters were pre-tested for aggression and then placed on a PE (n=10) or a PE-Free diet (n=10) for 4 weeks in isolation. During week 5, experimental hamsters were exposed to a group-housed, nonaggressive opponent (NAO) for 5 min in a neutral cage arena. PE-fed hamsters exhibited more attacks (33.4±6.1) toward the NAO compared to the PE-Free-fed hamsters (18.1±4) (p<0.05). Interestingly, testosterone in the blood serum was higher in the PE-fed group (11.01±1.48 ng/ml) compared to the PE-Free group (6.5±0.87 ng/ml). In Experiment 2, 16 juvenile hamsters were weaned onto a PE (n=8) or a PE-Free diet (n=8). After 7 weeks on the diet, experimental hamsters were exposed to a NAO for 5 min in a neutral cage arena. Although the PE group exhibited higher levels of aggressive behavior, there were no statistically significant differences between groups. However, the PE group had higher levels of testosterone (9.0±0.95 ng/ml) compared to the PE-Free group (4.6±0.98 ng/ml) (p<0.05). In addition, analysis of the brains from both experiments revealed differences in binding for vasopressin 1A (V1A) receptors. Optical densities were converted to disintegrating units per min/mg. The PE-Free group had higher levels of V1A receptor binding (2689.93±254.8 dpm/mg) compared to the PE group (1907.32±136.3 dpm/mg) in the lateral septum (p<0.05). In addition, there were differences in the lateral hypothalamus, but the PE group had higher receptor binding (2550.9±63.59 dpm/mg) when compared to the PE-Free group (2011.9±174.14 dpm/mg) (p<0.05). In sum, these data present the first evidence that phytoestrogens can affect aggressive behavior and, concurrently, alter hormonal status and stimulate changes in the brain of male hamsters.}

First, uncertainty-wise testing aims to ensure that the SUT deals with known uncertainty adequately. Second, uncertainty-wise testing should be also capable of learning new (previously unknown) uncertainties such that the SUT's implementation can be improved to guard against newly learned uncertainties during its operation. The necessity to integrate uncertainty in testing is becoming imperative because of the emergence of new types of intelligent and communicating software-based systems such as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). Intrinsically, such systems are exposed to uncertainty because of their interactions with highly indeterminate physical environments. In this chapter, we provide our understanding and experience of uncertainty-wise testing from the aspects of uncertainty-wise model-based testing, uncertainty-wise modeling and evolution of test ready models, and uncertainty-wise multiobjective test optimization, in the context of testing CPSs under uncertainty. Furthermore, we present our vision about this new testing paradigm and its plausible future research directions.}

In light of clinical reports suggesting that early benzodiazepine administration interferes with long-term recovery from traumatic stress, a prospective animal model for PTSD was employed to assess the short- and long-term effects of a brief course of alprazolam following stress exposure. Method: Animals exposed to stress were treated either 1 h or 7 days later with alprazolam or vehicle for 3-days. Outcome measures included behavior in the elevated plus-maze (EPM) and acoustic startle response (ASR) tests 30 days after initial exposure and freezing behavior upon exposure to a trauma-cue on day 31. One group was repeatedly exposed to the triggering trauma shortly before and after treatment and assessed as above. Circulating corticosterone levels were assessed 4 h after initiation of alprazolam and post-treatment. Pre-set cut-off behavioral criteria classified exposed animals according to their EPM and ASR response-patterns into ‘extreme’, ‘minimal,’ or ‘partial’ behavioral response for analysis of prevalence rates. Results: Immediate alprazolam treatment was effective in alleviating anxiety at day 4. No observable anxiolytic effects remained at day 30. Immediate alprazolam also resulted in significantly greater freezing response to trauma-cue exposure and in extreme responses to double-exposure. Corticosterone levels were significantly suppressed by alprazolam during treatment and rebounded after cessation. Conclusion: A brief course of alprazolam in the immediate aftermath of stress-exposure is associated with less favorable responses to additional stress-exposure later on. Alprazolam was associated with a significant attenuation of the HPA-response, suggesting a possible link between initial HPA-axis response disruption and the subsequent unfavorable outcomes.}

Rats in the SD group (n=10) were exposed to 1hour SD on two consecutive days, while control rats (n=10) were left undisturbed. Telemetric sleep recordings were performed before SD (day −1), day 1 post SD, and once weekly for 3weeks thereafter. The open field emergence test was performed on day 9 and weekly for 2weeks thereafter. Blood samples for measures of corticosterone responsiveness were drawn after the last emergence test (day 23). Acoustic startle responses were tested on day 24 post SD. Overall, SD rats as a group were not affected by the social conflict. Effects of SD seemed, however, to vary according to the behaviours that the intruder displayed during the social confrontation with the resident. Compared to those SD rats showing quick submission (SDS, n=5), SD rats fighting the resident during one or both SD confrontations before defeat (SDF, n=5) showed more fragmented slow wave sleep, both in SWS1 and SWS2. They also showed longer latency to leave the start box and spent less time in the open field arena compared to SDS rats. In the startle test, SDF rats failed to show response decrement at the lowest sound level. Our results indicate that how animals behave during a social confrontation is more important than exposure to the SD procedure itself, and that rapid submission during a social confrontation might be more adaptive than fighting back.}

Because E2 concentrations depend on aromatization of testosterone, changes in aromatase enzymatic activity (AA) are often utilized as a proxy to describe E2 concentrations. Utilizing two types of stimuli (sexual interactions and acute restraint stress) that have been demonstrated to reliably alter AA within minutes in opposite directions (sexual interactions=decrease, stress=increase), we tested in Japanese quail whether rapid changes in AA are paralleled by changes in E2 concentrations in discrete brain areas. In males, E2 in the pooled medial preoptic nucleus/medial portion of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (POM/BST) positively correlated with AA following sexual interactions. However, following acute stress, E2 decreased significantly (approximately 2-fold) in the male POM/BST despite a significant increase in AA. In females, AA positively correlated with E2 in both the POM/BST and mediobasal hypothalamus supporting a role for local, as opposed to ovarian, production regulating brain E2 concentrations. In addition, correlations of individual E2 in POM/BST and measurements of female sexual behavior suggested a role for local E2 synthesis in female receptivity. These data demonstrate that local E2 in the male brain changes in response to stimuli on a time course suggestive of potential non-genomic effects on brain and behavior. Overall, this study highlights the complex mechanisms regulating local E2 concentrations including rapid stimulus-driven changes in production and stress-induced changes in catabolism.}

abstract = {Accurately measuring and monitoring of animal behavior is an important factor when assessing on-farm animal welfare. First we developed a feasible and simple method aiming at consistently on-farm measuring of pig's behavior. This test should cover a broad range of welfare-related pig behavior. The reaction towards a novel object, startling, tail and ear biting, play and aggressive behavior, stereotypies, coughing, sneezing, skin lesions, defecation, urination and cleanliness of body and pen are included. The development of accurate measures of on-farm behavior first requires the reliability assessment of the procedure. Therefore, the methodology was tested in a first part by three observers scoring simultaneously and independently pre-defined behavioral characteristics of 108 group-housed fattening pigs. The inter-observer repeatability of the measures was calculated using intraclass correlation coefficients, which ranged from 0.7 to 1. In a second part, the objective was to validate the behavioral characteristics against salivary cortisol, urinary epinephrine and norepinephrine and production traits. Salivary cortisol concentrations significantly increased in ear-bitten pigs and in pigs with tail lesions. Growth rate significantly dropped when cortisol levels rose. An age effect was also found. The percentage of animals approaching the novel object is positively correlated with the urinary epinephrine concentration. Pigs defecating during the test showed significantly higher epinephrine levels. Urinary norepinephrine concentration decreased significantly with age. Faster growing animals and animals with tail lesions showed significantly higher levels of norepinephrine. Pen dirtiness and number of animals per pen were associated with higher norepinephrine concentrations. Finally, barrows had higher norepinephrine concentrations than sows.}

A computer-controlled testing setup was developed to minimize experimenter error and testing time. In order to assess the performance of this setup, refractory period estimates obtained in the newly designed, computer-controlled equipment were compared to those obtained in the hand-operated equipment used in previous experiments of this type. No meaningful differences were found. Thus, the more convenient computer-controlled setup was used to collect refractory period estimates from the VLT and LH. A comparison of these values revealed differences in the slopes of the recovery curves, and in the C-T intervals bracketing their rising portions. The VLT curves rose more gradually, and both began to rise and levelled off at longer C-T intervals than the LH curves. One explanation of these results is that the distribution of excitability in the LH substrate is shifted towards higher values than the VLT distribution. The overlapping portions of the recovery curves could reflect the contribution of a common bundle of reward-related fibers.}

Communications can be one of the most difficult parts of building robot architecture because of the increasing complexity of sensor and actuator hardware, and the interaction between intelligent features and real-time constraints. Currently, hybrid architectures offer the most widespread solutions for controlling intelligent mobile robots. This paper deals with the communications framework necessary to design and implement these architectures. The main goal of this work11This work has been partially funded with Spanish government project DPI2005-09327-C02-01/02. is to design a modular and portable architecture that allows the development of robot control systems. A multi-level and distributed architecture based on the reactive/deliberative paradigm is presented. Its main components are mobile software agents that interact through a distributed blackboard communications framework. These agents can be run on onboard processors, as well as on fixed workstations depending on their real-time restrictions. The presented control architecture has been tested in a real mobile robot and results demonstrate the effectiveness of distributing software agents to guarantee hard real-time execution.}

abstract = {The multiple memory systems theory (MMS) postulates that the brain stores information based on the independent and parallel activity of a number of modules, each with distinct properties, dynamics, and neural basis. Much of the evidence for this theory comes from dissociation studies indicating that damage to restricted brain areas cause selective types of memory deficits. MMS has been the prevalent paradigm in memory research for more than thirty years, even as it has been adjusted several times to accommodate new data. However, recent empirical results indicating that the memory systems are not always dissociable constitute a challenge to fundamental tenets of the current theory because they suggest that representations formed by individual memory systems can contribute to more than one type of memory-driven behavioral strategy. This problem can be addressed by applying a dynamic network perspective to memory architecture. According to this view, memory networks can reconfigure or transiently couple in response to environmental demands. Within this context, the neural network underlying a specific memory system can act as an independent unit or as an integrated component of a higher order meta-network. This dynamic network model proposes a way in which empirical evidence that challenges the idea of distinct memory systems can be incorporated within a modular memory architecture. The model also provides a framework to account for the complex interactions among memory systems demonstrated at the behavioral level. Advances in the study of dynamic networks can generate new ideas to experimentally manipulate and control memory in basic or clinical research.}

This study compared the effects of varying intensities and durations of endurance exercise using both motorized and voluntary running wheels after endothelin-I-induced focal ischemia in rats. Hippocampal levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, insulin-like growth factor I and synapsin-I were elevated in the ischemic hemisphere even in sedentary animals suggesting an intrinsic restorative response 2 weeks after ischemia. In the sensorimotor cortex and the hippocampus of the intact hemisphere, one episode of moderate walking exercise, but not more intense running, resulted in the greatest increases in levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and synapsin-I. Exercise did not increase brain-derived neurotrophic factor, insulin-like growth factor I or synapsin-I in the ischemic hemisphere. In voluntary running animals, both brain and serum insulin-like growth factor I appeared to be intensity dependent and were associated with decreasing serum levels of insulin-like growth factor I and increasing hippocampal levels of insulin-like growth factor I in the ischemic hemisphere. This supports the notion that exercise facilitates the movement of insulin-like growth factor I across the blood–brain barrier. Serum corticosterone levels were elevated by all exercise regimens and were highest in rats exposed to motorized running of greater speed or duration. The elevation of corticosterone did not seem to alter the expression of the proteins measured, however, graduated exercise protocols may be indicated early after stroke. These findings suggest that relatively modest exercise intervention can increase proteins involved in synaptic plasticity in areas of the brain that likely subserve motor relearning after stroke.}

Rats were trained to self-infuse nicotine intravenously (0.03mg/kg per infusion) following operant training. Once the rats acquired stable responding to nicotine self-infusion they were pretreated with NT69L (1mg/kg, i.p.) or saline 30min before being assessed for nicotine self-infusion. Pretreatment with NT69L significantly attenuated nicotine self-infusion under FR1 (fixed ratio of 1) and FR5 schedule of reinforcement as compared to saline pretreatment. Control rats that were response-independent “yoked” as well as rats that self-infused saline or NT69L showed minimal responses, indicating that nicotine served as a reinforcer. Additionally, NT69L modulated serum corticosterone; brain norepinephrine serotonin; and dopamine receptors mRNA levels altered in the nicotine self-infused rats after a 24h withdrawal period. Pretreatment with NT69L significantly decreased the nicotine-induced increase in serum corticosterone levels and striatal norepinephrine and increased the nicotine-induced reduction in serotonin in both the striatum and the prefrontal cortex (PFC). NT69L might modulate dopamine neurotransmission implicated in the reinforcing effects of nicotine by modulating tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine receptor mRNA levels in the PFC and striatum. These data support further study of the effects of NT analogs on attenuating the reinforcing effects of psychostimulants.}

abstract = {Recent evolution of communication networks has led toward increasingly complex communication protocols to interconnect heterogeneous systems. In order for such systems to function properly, communication protocols require formal methodologies for verification, implementation and testing. In this paper, the use of formal methods for protocol conformance testing is presented. Four major formal techniques for conformance test generation reported in the literature are compared: transition tours, distinguishing sequences, characterizing sequences and unique input/output sequences. The implementation of each approach as a test generation methodology is illustrated. The result is the capability to generate abstract test suites that require a minimum number of steps to execute while maintaining complete coverage of the state transitions (or test purposes) of the protocol. The impact of the formal methodologies on the practical aspects of conformance testing, including the test system implementation and automatic test script generation, is discussed. The experience based on testing various protocol implementations from multiple manufacturers at AT&T Bell Laboratories is described. The protocols tested include X.25 and ISDN Q.921 and Q.931 for basic and primary rate interfaces. In order to standardize various efforts on conformance testing, the ISO and the CCITT have developed principles to specify abstract and executable test suites, and methodologies to design testbed architectures. The relationship between such standards and the formal methods for test generation is explored.}

Although the chemosensory detection and olfactory toxicity of copper ions (Cu2+) has been heavily studied in fish, the olfactory-driven detection of copper nanoparticles (CuNPs)—a rapidly emerging contaminant to aquatic systems—remains largely unknown. This study aimed to investigate the olfactory response of rainbow trout to equitoxic concentrations of CuNPs or Cu2+ using electro-olfactography (EOG, a neurophysiological technique) and olfactory-mediated behavioural assay. In the first experiment, the concentration of contaminants known to impair olfaction by 20% over 24 h (EOG-based 24-h IC20s of 220 and 3.5 μg/L for CuNPs and Cu2+, respectively) were tested as olfactory stimuli using both neurophysiological and behavioural assays. In the second experiment, to determine whether the presence of CuNPs or Cu2+ can affect the ability of fish to perceive a social cue (taurocholic acid (TCA)), fish were acutely exposed to one form of Cu-contaminants (approximately 15 min). Following exposure, olfactory sensitivity was measured by EOG and olfactory-mediated behaviour within a choice maze was recorded in the presence of TCA. Results of neurophysiological and behavioural experiments demonstrate that rainbow trout can detect and avoid the IC20 of CuNPs. The IC20 of Cu2+ was below the olfactory detection threshold of rainbow trout, as such, fish did not avoid Cu2+. The high sensitivity of behavioural endpoints revealed a lack of aversion response to TCA in CuNP-exposed fish, despite this change not being present utilizing EOG. The reduced response to TCA during the brief exposure to CuNPs may be a result of either olfactory fatigue or blockage of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) by CuNPs. The observed behavioural interference caused by CuNP exposure may indicate that CuNPs have the ability to interfere with other behaviours potentially affecting fitness and survival. Our findings also revealed the differential response of OSNs to CuNPs and Cu2+.}

These notions allow for structuring the test process for SPLs by taking variability into account and extracting separate test suites for common and specific features of an SPL. The introduced notions of residual and spinal test suites allow for focusing on the newly introduced behavior and avoiding unnecessary re-test of the old one. Residual test suites are very conservative in that they require retesting the old behavior that can reach to new behavior. However, spinal test suites more aggressively prune the old tests and only focus on those test sequences that are necessary in reaching the new behavior. We show that residual testing is complete but does not usually lead to much reduction in the test-suite. In contrast, spinal testing is not necessarily complete but does reduce the test-suite. We give sufficient conditions on the implementation to guarantee completeness of spinal testing. Finally, we specify and analyze an example regarding the Ceiling Speed Monitoring Function from the European Train Control System.}

By making sound audible from the first months of life through hearing aids, it is possible to harness auditory plasticity and maximize lifetime auditory potential. For infants with profound hearing loss or auditory neuropathy the option of cochlear implantation may give improved hearing for speech, typically at around 12 months of age. The onus of responsibility for using hearing aids and providing a suitable sound environment for the child falls on the parents. This is best achieved using a family-centred model of audiology management rather than the traditional expert- or medical-models of intervention. For later-onset hearing loss, particularly conductive hearing loss secondary to otitis media or other middle-ear conditions, there is no longer a national screening programme in the UK with a greater reliance on surveillance. Many school-entry screens of hearing have been disbanded (with the joint understanding that community audiology services should be open to a wide range of referrals and easy to access) and there is risk of children with later-onset hearing loss being overlooked despite the recognised secondary effects of untreated hearing loss on speech development, social interaction and subsequent educational achievement. This article reviews the current knowledge base and discusses the appropriate methods of behavioural assessment techniques useful for healthcare professionals.}

The surfactant-stabilized N2/CO2 foams are two of the most widely used foams in foam EOR processes, and numerous oil reservoirs could potentially benefit from them. This paper comprehensively reviews the development of these foams over the past decade. We focused on the promising surfactant formulas and their corresponding mechanisms under different reservoir conditions, especially harsh conditions. The most recent studies have shown that low interfacial tension foaming surfactants are efficient in fractured/tight reservoirs, while CO2-switchable surfactants are well suited to CO2 foam in carbonate reservoirs with high temperatures. Pure surfactants and mixed surfactants that combine anions and cations contain superior foam properties. The surfactant aggregates, such as vesicles and wormlike micelles, could distinctly enhance the foam stability. However, the adsorption of the mixed surfactants on reservoir rocks and the temperature sensitivity of the complex structures should be given particular consideration. The phase behaviors involved in foam EOR processes are vital and much more complicated than those in other EOR processes. Thus, a better knowledge of the phase behaviors could further improve foam EOR performance. The results of this paper provide clues to N2/CO2 foam EOR design and also promote the development of harsh reservoirs.}

The current study utilized exposure to juvenile stress, which was previously shown to have long-term effects into adulthood in male rats, to compare early to adulthood consequences of juvenile stress on anxiety indices and exploratory behavior in the open field and elevated plus maze. Furthermore, both male and female rats were examined, and in addition, the role of corticosterone as a potential mediator of some of these effects in juvenility and in adulthood, was assessed. Experiments 1–2 examined in male and female rats immediate and long-term behavioral effects of juvenile stress. Experiment 3 assessed circulating corticosterone (CORT) levels, and in experiment 4 male and female rats were injected i.p. with CORT, in either juvenility or in adulthood, to examine whether CORT could mimic the effects of juvenile stress. As expected, in adulthood, juvenile stress resulted in reduced exploratory behavior and reduced exploration of high-risk areas of the mazes. A similar pattern was found in both males and females. In contrast, a reversed behavioral pattern was found in juvenility in both male and female rats, although detailed differences were found between sexes. The application of CORT induced a similar reversed behavioral pattern in juvenile and adult rats of both sexes. Thus, the juvenile stress model might serve as an animal model for studying early-onset of affective illness.}

We examined the effect of reproductive experience on aggression in a biparental species of mouse, Peromyscus californicus. Estrogens are important in mediating aggressive behavior so we also examined estrogen receptor expression and c-fos for insights into possible mechanisms of regulation. Parental males were significantly more aggressive than virgin males, but no significant differences in estrogen receptor alpha or beta expression were detected. Patterns of c-fos following aggression tests suggested possible parallels with maternal aggression. Parental males had more c-fos positive cells in the medial amygdala, and medial preoptic area relative to virgin males. The medial preoptic area is generally considered to be relatively less important for male-male aggression in rodents, but is known to have increased activity in the context of maternal aggression. We also demonstrated through habituation–dishabituation tests that parental males show exaggerated investigation responses to chemical cues from a male intruder, suggesting that heightened sensory responses may contribute to increased parental aggression. These data suggest that, in biparental species, reproductive experience leads to the onset of paternal aggression that may be analogous to maternal aggression.}

abstract = {Objectives
Cortical auditory evoked potentials (CAEPs) to tones and speech sounds were obtained in infants to: (1) further knowledge of auditory development above the level of the brainstem during the first year of life; (2) establish CAEP input–output functions for tonal and speech stimuli as a function of stimulus level and (3) elaborate the data-base that establishes CAEP in infants tested while awake using clinically relevant stimuli, thus providing methodology that would have translation to pediatric audiological assessment. Hypotheses concerning CAEP development were that the latency and amplitude input–output functions would reflect immaturity in encoding stimulus level. In a second experiment, infants were tested with the same stimuli used to evoke the CAEPs. Thresholds for these stimuli were determined using observer-based psychophysical techniques. The hypothesis was that the behavioral thresholds would be correlated with CAEP input–output functions because of shared cortical response areas known to be active in sound detection.
Design
36 infants, between the ages of 4 and 12 months (mean=8 months, s.d.=1.8 months) and 9 young adults (mean age 21 years) with normal hearing were tested. First, CAEPs amplitude and latency input–output functions were obtained for 4 tone bursts and 7 speech tokens. The tone bursts stimuli were 50ms tokens of pure tones at 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0kHz. The speech sound tokens, /a/, /i/, /o/, /u/, /m/, /s/, and /∫/, were created from natural speech samples and were also 50ms in duration. CAEPs were obtained for tone burst and speech token stimuli at 10dB level decrements in descending order from 70dB SPL. All CAEP tests were completed while the infants were awake and engaged in quiet play. For the second experiment, observer-based psychophysical methods were used to establish perceptual threshold for the same speech sound and tone tokens.
Results
Infant CAEP component latencies were prolonged by 100–150ms in comparison to adults. CAEP latency-intensity input output functions were steeper in infants compared to adults. CAEP amplitude growth functions with respect to stimulus SPL are adult-like at this age, particularly for the earliest component, P1–N1. Infant perceptual thresholds were elevated with respect to those found in adults. Furthermore, perceptual thresholds were higher, on average, than levels at which CAEPs could be obtained. When CAEP amplitudes were plotted with respect to perceptual threshold (dB SL), the infant CAEP amplitude growth slopes were steeper than in adults.
Conclusions
Although CAEP latencies indicate immaturity in neural transmission at the level of the cortex, amplitude growth with respect to stimulus SPL is adult-like at this age, particularly for the earliest component, P1–N1. The latency and amplitude input–output functions may provide additional information as to how infants perceive stimulus level. The reasons for the discrepancy between electrophysiologic and perceptual threshold may be due to immaturity in perceptual temporal resolution abilities and the broad-band listening strategy employed by infants. The findings from the current study can be translated to the clinical setting. It is possible to use tonal or speech sound tokens to evoke CAEPs in an awake, passively alert infant, and thus determine whether these sounds activate the auditory cortex. This could be beneficial in the verification of hearing aid or cochlear implant benefit.}

In the current study, we investigated the learning and memory processes of NF-M transgenic mice at 3 and 8 months of age in a modified Morris water maze using a series of tasks including those primarily related to reference memory (i.e., spatial learning, reversal learning and probe trials) and to working memory (i.e., matching to sample tasks with or without delays). At 3 months of age, NF-M transgenic mice were indistinguishable from age- and litter-matched non-transgenic wild-type controls on any of the tests of reference and working memory. At 8 months of age, however, the NF-M transgenic mice exhibited significantly poorer performance than the age- and litter-matched wild-type control mice on both reference and working memory tasks. Immunohistohistological study of the brains of the 8-month-old NF-M transgenic mice revealed spherical and tangle-like neurofilamentous accumulation in their cerebral cortices. These results suggest that NF-M transgenic mice express both age-related histopathological changes and age-dependent learning and memory deficits. Whether NF-M transgenic mice exhibit even more severe behavioral impairments when they become aged is currently under study.}

We examined the consequences of social subordination (low social rank) in juvenile female rhesus monkeys, as an ethologically valid model of chronic social stressor exposure, on brain structural and behavioral development through the pubertal transition. Adolescence is a developmental period of extensive brain remodeling and increased emotional and stress reactivity. Puberty-induced increases in gonadal hormones, particularly estradiol (E2), are likely involved due to its organizational effects on the brain and behavior. Thus, we also examined how experimentally delaying pubertal onset with Lupron (gonadotropin releasing hormone -GnRH- agonist used clinically to delay early puberty) interacted with social rank (dominant vs. subordinate) to affect brain and behavioral outcomes. Using a longitudinal experimental design, structural MRI (sMRI) scans were collected on socially housed juvenile female rhesus monkeys living in indoor-outdoor enclosures prior to the onset of puberty (18–25 months), defined as menarche or the initial occurrence of perineal swelling and coloration, and again at 29–36 months, when all control animals had reached puberty but none of the Lupron-treated had. We examined the effects of both social rank and pubertal delay on overall structural brain volume (i.e. intracranial, grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volumes), as well as on cortico-limbic regions involved in emotion and stress regulation: amygdala (AMYG), hippocampus (HC), and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Measures of stress physiology, social behavior, and emotional reactivity were collected to examine functional correlates of the brain structural effects. Apart from expected developmental effects, subordinates had bigger AMYG volumes than dominant animals, most notably in the right hemisphere, but pubertal delay with Lupron-treatment abolished those differences, suggesting a role of gonadal hormones potentiating the brain structural impact of social stress. Subordinates also had elevated baseline cortisol, indicating activation of stress systems. In general, Lupron-treated subjects had smaller AMYG and HC volume than controls, but larger total PFC (driven by bigger GM volumes), and different, region-specific, developmental patterns dependent on age and social rank. These findings highlight a region-specific effect of E2 on structural development during female adolescence, independent of those due to chronological age. Pubertal delay and AMYG volume, in turn, predicted differences in emotional reactivity and social behavior. These findings suggest that exposure to developmental increases in E2 modifies the consequences of adverse social experience on the volume of cortico-limbic regions involved in emotional and stress regulation during maturation. But, even more importantly, they indicate different brain structural effects of chronological age and pubertal developmental stage in females, which are very difficult to disentangle in human studies. These findings have additional relevance for young girls who experience prolonged pubertal delays or for those whose puberty is clinically arrested by pharmacological administration of Lupron.}

abstract = {For meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus, seasonal differences exist in self-grooming and in odor preferences for conspecifics, two behaviors which facilitate sexual interactions in this species. Both behaviors are mediated by photoperiodically-induced changes in circulating gonadal steroid hormone titers which, in turn, can be transduced by the duration of the melatonin signal that a seasonally breeding animal receives. The goal of this study was to determine whether exogenous melatonin administration affects circulating gonadal steroid hormone titers in meadow voles, and whether it influences their odor preferences and self-grooming behavior to same- and opposite-sex conspecifics. Long-photoperiod voles that did not receive exogenous melatonin had higher testosterone (males) and estradiol (females) titers than did short-photoperiod voles and long-photoperiod voles treated with melatonin for 12 weeks; the latter had similar estradiol and testosterone titers. Long-photoperiod voles that did not receive melatonin preferred the scent marks of long-photoperiod opposite-sex conspecifics and spent more time self-grooming in response to their odors than those of either long-photoperiod same-sex, short-photoperiod same-sex, or short-photoperiod opposite-sex conspecifics. Long-photoperiod voles that received melatonin, however, no longer preferred the marks of long-photoperiod opposite-sex conspecifics and no longer spent more time self-grooming in response to their odors, not unlike the odor preferences and self-grooming behavior of short-photoperiod voles. As a whole, the data suggest that the duration of the melatonin signal is likely involved in mediating the photoperiodically-induced changes in gonadal steroid hormones that mediate a meadow vole's odor preferences for opposite-sex conspecifics and its self-grooming response to those marks.}

They seek to ensure low queueing delay and high network goodput without requiring parameter tuning of the algorithms themselves. However, extensive experimental evaluations of these algorithms are still lacking. This paper evaluates a selection of bottleneck queue management schemes in a test-bed representative of residential Internet connections of both symmetrical and asymmetrical bandwidths as well as WiFi. Latency under load and the performance of VoIP and web traffic patterns are evaluated under steady state conditions. Furthermore, the impact of the algorithms on fairness between TCP flows with different RTTs, and also the transient behaviour of the algorithms at flow startup is examined. The results show that while the AQM algorithms can significantly improve steady state performance, they exacerbate TCP flow unfairness. In addition, the evaluated AQMs severely struggle to quickly control queueing latency at flow startup, which can lead to large latency spikes that hurt the perceived performance. The fairness queueing algorithms almost completely alleviate the algorithm performance problems, providing the best balance of low latency and high throughput in the tested scenarios. However, on WiFi the performance of all the tested algorithms is hampered by large amounts of queueing in lower layers of the network stack inducing significant latency outside of the algorithms’ control.}

abstract = {The zebrafish lens opaque (lop) mutant was previously isolated in a genetic screen and shown to lack rod and cone photoreceptors and exhibit lens opacity, or cataract, at 7 days post-fertilization (dpf). In this manuscript, we provide four different lines of evidence demonstrating that the lop phenotype results from a defect in the cdipt (phosphatidylinositol (PI) synthase; CDP-diacylglycerol-inositol 3-phosphatidyltransferase) gene. First, DNA sequence analysis revealed that the lop mutant contained a missense mutation in the lop open reading frame, which yields a nonconservative amino acid substitution (Ser-111-Cys) within the PI synthase catalytic domain. Second, morpholino-mediated knockdown of the cdipt-encoded PI synthase protein phenocopied the cdiptlop/lop mutant, with abnormal lens epithelial and secondary fiber cell morphologies and reduced numbers of photoreceptors. Third, microinjection of in vitro transcribed, wild-type cdipt mRNA into 1–4 cell stage cdiptlop/lop embryos significantly reduced the percentage of larvae displaying lens opacity at 7 dpf. Fourth, a cdipt retroviral-insertion allele, cdipthi559, exhibited similar lens and retinal abnormalities and failed to complement the cdiptlop mutant phenotype. To determine the initial cellular defects associated with the cdipt mutant, we examined homozygous cdipthi559/hi559 mutants prior to gross lens opacification at 6 dpf. The cdipthi559/hi559 mutants first exhibited photoreceptor layer disruption and photoreceptor cell death at 3 and 4 dpf, respectively, followed by lens dismorphogenesis by 5 dpf. RT-PCR revealed that the cdipt gene is maternally expressed and continues to be transcribed throughout development and into adulthood, in a wide variety of tissues. Using an anti-zebrafish PI synthase polyclonal antiserum, we localized the protein throughout the developing eye, including the photoreceptor layer and lens cortical secondary fiber cells. As expected, the polyclonal antiserum revealed that the PI synthase protein was reduced in amount in both the cdiptlop/lop and cdipthi559/hi559 mutants. Furthermore, we used a heterologous yeast phenotypic complementation assay to confirm that the wild-type zebrafish cdipt allele encodes functional PI synthase activity. Taken together, the cdipt-encoded PI synthase is required for survival of photoreceptor cells and lens epithelial and secondary cortical fiber cells. These zebrafish cdipt alleles represent excellent in vivo genetic tools to study the role of phosphatidylinositol and its phosphorylated derivatives in lens and photoreceptor development and maintenance.}

The mechanisms that affect sexual behavior and food intake are closely related to one another; chief among the mechanisms that control sexual behaviors in females is estradiol. In order to understand how food deprivation results in inhibition of sexual behavior (attractivity, proceptivity, and receptivity), we measured the effects of food deprivation on circulating concentrations of estradiol. We also determined whether estradiol treatment was sufficient to restore sexual behaviors in food-deprived female meadow voles. We found that estradiol titers of food-deprived female voles are significantly lower than those of ad lib-fed female voles. Further, we found that estradiol treatment was sufficient to restore proceptivity and receptivity in food-deprived, ovariectomized female voles. However, estradiol treatment was not able to overcome the food deprivation-induced inhibition of attractivity. Thus, decreases in estradiol titer of food-deprived female voles may be related to the suppression of their proceptive and receptive behaviors, and may be a mechanism that allows females to avoid mating when conditions are not propitious for their survival and that of their offspring.}

The research protocol entailed biological sampling before and after a 20-min behavioral session during which single men sat alone and fathers interacted with their partner and youngest child. Hormone measures relied upon minimally invasive techniques (salivary testosterone and cortisol, finger prick blood spot prolactin, urinary oxytocin and vasopressin). Results revealed significant group differences in average male testosterone levels (p=0.006), with post hoc contrasts indicating that visiting fathers had significantly (p<0.05) lower testosterone levels than single men. Prolactin profiles also differed significantly across groups (p=0.010) whereby post hoc contrasts showed that prolactin levels of single men declined significantly compared with the flat levels of visiting fathers (p<0.05). No group differences in cortisol, oxytocin or vasopressin levels were observed. However, among fathers, vasopressin levels were significantly and negatively (r=−.431, p=0.022) correlated with the age of a man's youngest child. These results thus implicate lower testosterone levels as well as prolactin and vasopressin in human fatherhood. These findings also highlight the importance of sociocultural context in human fatherhood while exhibiting parallels with existing data on the non-human vertebrate hormonal bases of paternal care.}

Furthermore, an automated derivation of retesting obligations based on accurate delta-oriented architectural change impact analysis is provided. Based on a formal conceptual framework that guarantees stable test coverage for every system variant, we present a sample implementation of our approach and an evaluation of the validity and efficiency by means of a case study from the automotive domain.}

In this study, we used radioligand receptor autoradiography to examine whether changes in agonistic behavior following acute and repeated social defeat are accompanied by changes in AVP V1a receptor binding. Social defeat produced high levels of submissive behavior and a loss of territorial aggression when hamsters were subsequently tested with a novel intruder, and repeated agonistic encounters produced similar behavioral changes in subordinates. AVP V1a receptor binding was not reduced by acute social defeat but was affected by repeated agonistic encounters. Dominants had significantly more AVP V1a receptor binding in lateral portions of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHL) than did their subordinate opponents, but subordinates were no different from controls. In contrast, receptor binding did not differ in most other brain regions examined. The changes in receptor binding appear to be independent of testosterone levels, as testosterone levels did not differ among dominants, subordinates, and controls. Our results suggest that changes in AVP V1a receptors do not account for the changes in agonistic behavior produced by acute social defeat but AVP V1a binding in the VMHL correlates with, and may modulate, the behavioral changes that occur following repeated experiences of victory.}

abstract = {Although aromatase is expressed in both male and female brains, its functional significance in females remains poorly understood. In female quail, sexual receptivity is activated by estrogens. However it is not known whether sexual motivation is similarly estrogen-dependent and whether estrogens locally produced in the brain contribute to these behavioral responses. Four main experiments were designed to address these questions. In Experiment 1 chronic treatment of females with the anti-estrogen tamoxifen decreased their receptivity, confirming that this response is under the control of estrogens. In Experiment 2 chronic treatment with tamoxifen significantly decreased sexual motivation as treated females no longer approached a sexual partner. In Experiment 3 (a) ovariectomy (OVX) induced a significant decrease of time spent near the male and a significantly decreased receptivity compared to gonadally intact females, (b) treatment with testosterone (OVX+T) partially restored these responses and (c) this effect of T was prevented when estradiol synthesis was inhibited by the potent aromatase inhibitor Vorozole (OVX+T+VOR). Serum estradiol concentration was significantly higher in OVX+T than in OVX or OVX+T+VOR females. Together these data demonstrate that treatment of OVX females with T increases sexual motivation and that these effects are mediated at least in part by non-gonadal aromatization of the androgen. Finally, assays of aromatase activity on brain and peripheral tissues (Experiment 4) strongly suggest that brain aromatization contributes to behavioral effects observed here following T treatment but alternative sources of estrogens (e.g. liver) should also be considered.}

abstract = {Recent clinical reports indicate that combined administration of phentermine and fenfluramine may have useful effects in the treatment of drug abuse. The present study was designed to evaluate the subjective and mood-altering effects of these drugs, alone and in combination, in normal healthy volunteers. Seven male and five female volunteers participated in an eight-session, double-blind study in which each subject received each of the following drug conditions: d-amphetamine (10 and 20 mg), phentermine (30 mg), fenfluramine (40 and 80 mg), phentermine (30 mg) with fenfluramine (40 mg), phentermine (30 mg) with fenfluramine (80 mg), and placebo. Sessions were conducted in a laboratory setting two or three days a week. Subjects completed standardized self-report questionnaires and psychomotor tests before and at regular intervals after each drug administration. Phentermine produced effects that were similar to those of d-amphetamine, whereas fenfluramine produced different and apparently aversive effects (e.g., it increased measures of anxiety and confusion). Phentermine reduced the apparently aversive effects of fenfluramine when the two drugs were given together. These results suggest that the combination of phentermine and fenfluramine would have a low potential for abuse.}
