            Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) blend digital and physical processes. CPS software is the key to realizing their functionalities. This software needs to evolve to deal with different aspects, such as the implementation of new functionalities or bug fixes. Because of this, design–operation methods, colloquially known as “DevOps,” are paramount to be adopted within these systems. During DevOps phases, automating test execution at design time is a key enabler of streamlined software development and software quality improvement. Likewise, monitoring whether a CPS is behaving as expected at operation is similarly important. In DevOps, test oracles play an important role in enabling automated testing, ensuring the reliability of software deployments, providing feedback to developers, etc. However, defining and generating test oracles in the context of DevOps practices in CPSs need to accommodate aspects specific to CPSs, such as their time-continuous behavior and inherent uncertainties. To this end, in this paper, we propose a domain-specific language (DSL) to ease the definition of test oracles and an automated solution for generating a microservice encapsulating the defined test oracles, which is compatible with a DevOps ecosystem for CPSs. We evaluated our DSL with two industrial case study systems and 9 open-source CPSs. Our evaluation results suggest that our DSL can model around 98\% of the requirements of these systems through test oracles. Furthermore, it is possible to generate a microservice to be applicable at different test levels within less than 20 min, being fast enough to be adopted in practice.},

              The use of diverse mobile applications among senior users is becoming increasingly widespread. However, many of these apps contain accessibility problems that result in negative user experiences for seniors. A key reason is that software practitioners often lack the time or resources to address the broad spectrum of age-related accessibility and personalisation needs. As current developer tools and practices encourage one-size-fits-all interfaces with limited potential to address the diversity of senior needs, there is a growing demand for approaches that support the systematic creation of adaptive, accessible app experiences. To this end, we present
              AdaptForge
              , a novel model-driven engineering (MDE) approach that enables advanced design-time adaptations of mobile application interfaces and behaviours tailored to the accessibility needs of senior users.
              AdaptForge
               uses two domain-specific languages (DSLs) to address age-related accessibility needs. The first model defines users’ context-of-use parameters, while the second defines conditional accessibility scenarios and corresponding UI adaptation rules. These rules are interpreted by an MDE workflow to transform an app’s original source code into personalised instances. We also report evaluations with professional software developers and senior end-users, demonstrating the feasibility and practical utility of

              An execution trace is a model of a single system behavior. Execution traces occur everywhere in the system’s lifecycle as they can typically be produced by executable models, by prototypes of (sub)systems, and by the system itself during its operation. An execution trace can be visualized and analyzed with various techniques, providing insight into the dynamic behavior, performance, bottlenecks, etc., of the system. In this paper, we present the Trace tool of the Eclipse
              Trace4cps
              project for the visualization and analysis of execution traces. A prominent application is the trace-based performance engineering of embedded or cyber-physical systems. Performance is an important system quality, as it can give a competitive advantage. Reasoning about system-level performance in such systems, however, is hard due to its cross-cutting nature. We show how the Trace tool can support this by various examples. Performance engineering is not the only application of the Trace tool, however: it supports system analysis in a wide range of situations.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Currently, the most widespread software quality assurance methods in the avionics domain are semi-automated reviews and testing. However, their effort grows disproportionately to the size of the system under development. Also, these methods cannot achieve exhaustive coverage due to the complexity of today’s avionics systems and their potentially infinite set of combinations of possible inputs and system states. Furthermore, the later software issues are detected in the development process, the more expensive it is to fix them. To overcome these issues, a model-driven verification approach for modeling and analyzing avionics systems in early phases of the development is presented. To this end, semantics is given to SysML v2 models by a mapping to a theorem prover encoding. The development of a dedicated SysML v2 profile supporting event-driven data flow specifications, the encoding of corresponding structures in the theorem prover Isabelle, and a generator creating theorems from SysML v2 models are presented. The approach is evaluated by formally proving a representative liveness property of a hierarchical system model from the avionics domain. Since liveness properties can be negated only by infinite data sequences and thus cannot be covered exhaustively by testing, this case study demonstrates the added value for meeting typical safety requirements in the avionics domain. The results can be transferred from avionics to other domains, as well.},

            A Software Product Line (SPL) is a software development paradigm in which a family of software products shares a set of core assets. Testing has a vital role in both single-system development and SPL development in identifying potential faults by examining the behavior of a product or products, but it is especially challenging in SPL. There have been many research contributions in the SPL testing field; therefore, assessing the current state of research and practice is necessary to understand the progress in testing practices and to identify the gap between required techniques and existing approaches. This paper aims to survey existing research on SPL testing to provide researchers and practitioners with up-to-date evidence and issues that enable further development of the field. To this end, we conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) with seven research questions in which we identified and analyzed 118 studies dating from 2003 to 2022. The results indicate that the literature proposes many techniques for specific aspects (e.g., controlling cost/effort in SPL testing); however, other elements (e.g., regression testing and non-functional testing) still need to be covered by existing research. Furthermore, most approaches are evaluated by only one empirical method, most of which are academic evaluations. This may jeopardize the adoption of approaches in industry. The results of this study can help identify gaps in SPL testing since specific points of SPL Engineering still need to be addressed entirely.},

            The development process of on-board software applications can benefit from model-driven engineering techniques. Model validation and model transformations can be applied to drive the activities of specification, requirements definition, and system-level validation and verification according to the space software engineering standards ECSS-E-ST-40 and ECSS-Q-ST-80. This paper presents a model-driven approach to completing these activities by avoiding inconsistencies between the documents that support them and providing the ability to automatically generate the system-level validation tests that are run on the Ground Support Equipment and the matrices required to complete the software verification. A demonstrator of the approach has been built using as a proof of concept a subset of the functionality of the software of the control unit of the Energetic Particle Detector instrument on-board Solar Orbiter.},

            Auditory sensory differences are common in the autistic population, often causing daily challenges. Audio technology offers support in managing auditory environments and can be a useful resource in various contexts. This scoping review examined 17 studies on the use of audio technology for autistic persons with auditory sensory differences, highlighting significant research gaps. Findings reveal limited empirical research integrating technology and autism perspectives. The studies predominantly use quantitative methods, small, narrowly aged samples, under-representation of females and individuals with intellectual disabilities, and high dropout rates. Few studies assess acceptability. Further studies on audio technology for autistic persons with auditory sensory differences are needed to address gaps and facilitate the auditory environment for autistic persons.},

            One in six Americans suffers from hearing loss. While treatment with amplification is possible for many, the acceptance rate of hearing aids is low. Poor device fitting is one of the reasons. The hearing aid fitting starts with a detailed hearing assessment by a trained audiologist in a sound-controlled environment, using standard equipment. The hearing aid is adjusted step-by-step, following well-described procedures based on the audiogram. However, for many patients in rural settings, considerable travel time to a hearing center discourages them from receiving a hearing test and treatment. We hypothesize that hearing assessment with the patient’s hearing aid can reliably substitute the hearing test in the clinic. Over-the-counter hearing aids could be programmed from a distance and fine-tuned by the hearing aid wearer. This study shows that a patient-controlled hearing assessment via a hearing aid in a non-clinical setting is not statistically different from an audiologist-controlled hearing assessment in a clinical setting. The differences in hearing obtained with our device and the Gaussian Process are within 3 dB of the standard audiogram. At 250 Hz, the sound delivery with the hearing aid used in this study added an additional reduction of sound level, which was not compensated.},

            Offline model-level testing of autonomous driving software is much cheaper, faster, and diversified than in-field, online system-level testing. Hence, researchers have compared empirically model-level vs system-level testing using driving simulators. They reported the general usefulness of simulators at reproducing the same conditions experienced in-field, but also some inadequacy of model-level testing at exposing failures that are observable only in online mode. In this work, we replicate the reference study on model vs system-level testing of autonomous vehicles while acknowledging several assumptions that we had reconsidered. These assumptions are related to several threats to validity affecting the original study that motivated additional analysis and the development of techniques to mitigate them. Moreover, we also extend the replicated study by evaluating the original findings when considering a physical, radio-controlled autonomous vehicle. Our results show that simulator-based testing of autonomous driving systems yields predictions that are close to the ones of real-world datasets when using neural-based translation to mitigate the reality gap induced by the simulation platform. On the other hand, model-level testing failures are in line with those experienced at the system level, both in simulated and physical environments, when considering the pre-failure site, similar-looking images, and accurate labels.},

            The massive deployment of distributed generators from renewable sources in recent years has led to a fundamental paradigm change in terms of planning and operation of the electric power system. The usage of advanced automation and information and communication technology is a key element to handle these new challenges and to turn the traditional power system into a smart grid. The implementation of such complex systems solutions is associated with increasing development complexity resulting in increased engineering costs. The traditional engineering methods used for power system automation were not intended to be used for applications of this scale and complexity. However, the usage of proper methods, automation architectures, and corresponding tools holds huge optimization potential for the engineering process. Therefore, this work presents a model-based engineering and validation support system, covering the overall engineering process for smart grid applications.},

            When developing a Learning Management System (LMS) using Scrum, we noticed that it was quite often necessary to redefine some system behaviour scenarios, due to ambiguities in the requirement specifications, or due to misinterpretations of stories reported by the Product Owners (POs). The definition of test suites was also cumbersome, resulting in test suites that were incomplete or did not at all comply with the system requirements. Based on this experience and to deal with these problems, in this paper, we propose the ScrumOntoBDD approach to agile software development, which combines Scrum, ontologies and Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD). This approach is centred on the concepts and techniques of Scrum and BDD and focuses on the planning and analysis phases of the software life cycle, since the BDD tools currently provide little support to these phases, while most of the problems during the LMS development were found exactly there. We claim that our approach improves the software development practices in this respect. Furthermore, ScrumOntoBDD employs ontologies in order to reduce ambiguities intrinsic to the use of a natural language as a BDD ubiquitous language. In this paper, we illustrate and systematically evaluate our approach, showing that it is beneficial since it improves the communication between members of an agile development team.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The discipline of enterprise architecture (EA) is an established approach to model and manage the interaction of business processes and IT in an organization. Thereby, the EA model as a central artifact of EA is subject to a continuous evolution caused by multiple sources of changes. The continuous evolution requires a lot of effort in controlling and managing the evolution of the EA model. This is especially true when merging the induced changes from different sources in the EA model. Additionally, the lack of tool and automation support makes this a very time-consuming and error-prone task. The evolutionary character and the automated quality assessment of artifacts is a well-known challenge in the software development domain as well. To meet these challenges, the discipline of continuous delivery (CD) has emerged to be very useful. The evolution of EA model artifacts shows similarities to the evolution of software artifacts. Therefore, we leveraged practices of CD to practices of EA maintenance. Thus, we created a conceptual framework for automated EA model maintenance. The concepts were realized in a first prototype and were evaluated in a fictitious case study against equivalence classes based on EA model metrics and a set of several requirements for automated EA model maintenance from research. Overall, the concepts prove to be a promising basis for further refinement, implementation, and evaluation in research in an industrial context.},

            Bug reports are used by software testers to identify abnormal software behaviour. In this paper, we propose a multi-objective evolutionary approach to automatically generate finite state machines (FSMs) based on bug reports written in natural language, to automatically capture incorrect software behaviour. These FSMs can then be used by testers to both exercise the reported bugs and create tests that can potentially reveal new bugs. The FSM generation is guided by a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA) that simultaneously minimises three objectives: size of the models, number of unrealistic states (over-generalisation), and number of states not covered by the models (under-generalisation). We assess the feasibility of our approach for 10 real-world software programs by exploiting three different MOEAs (NSGA-II, NSGA-III and MOEA/D) and benchmarking them with the baseline tool KLFA. Our results show that KLFA is not practical to be used with real-world software, because it generates models that over generalise software behaviour. Among the three MOEAs, NSGA-II obtained significantly better results than the other two for all 10 programs, detecting a greater number of bugs for 90\% of the programs. We also studied the differences in quality and model performance when MOEAs are guided by only two objectives rather than three during the evolution. We found that the use of under-approximation (or over-approximation) and size as objectives generates infeasible solutions. On the other hand, using as objectives over-approximation and under-approximation generates feasible solutions yet still worse than those obtained using all three objectives for 100\% of the cases. The size objective acts as a diversity factor. As a consequence, an algorithm guided by all three objectives avoids local optima, controls the size of the models, and makes the results more diverse and closer to the optimal Pareto set.},

            Classically, estrogens regulate male sexual behavior through effects initiated in the nucleus. However, neuroestrogens, i.e., estrogens locally produced in the brain, can act within minutes via membrane-initiated events. In male quail, rapid changes in brain aromatase activity occur after exposure to sexual stimuli. We report here that local extracellular estrogen concentrations measured by in vivo microdialysis increase during sexual interactions in a brain site- and stimulus-specific manner. Indeed, estrogen concentrations rose within 10 min of the initiation of sexual interaction with a female in the medial preoptic nucleus only, while visual access to a female led to an increase in estrogen concentrations only in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. These are the fastest fluctuations in local estrogen concentrations ever observed in the vertebrate brain. Their site and stimulus specificity strongly confirm the neuromodulatory function of neuroestrogens on behavior.},

            When custom modeling tools are used for designing complex safety-critical systems (e.g., critical cyber-physical systems), the tools themselves need to be validated by systematic testing to prevent tool-specific bugs reaching the system. Testing of such modeling tools relies upon an automatically generated set of models as a test suite. While many software testing practices recommend that this test suite should be diverse, model diversity has not been studied systematically for graph models. In the paper, we propose different diversity metrics for models by generalizing and exploiting neighborhood and predicate shapes as abstraction. We evaluate such shape-based diversity metrics using various distance functions in the context of mutation testing of graph constraints and access policies for two separate industrial DSLs. Furthermore, we evaluate the quality (i.e., bug detection capability) of different (random and consistent) model generation techniques for mutation testing purposes.},

              This work investigates the performance of the
              on-demand machine learning (ODML) algorithm
              introduced in Leal et al. (
              Transp. Porous Media
              133
              (2), 161–204, 2020) when applied to different reactive transport problems in heterogeneous porous media. This approach was devised to accelerate the computationally expensive geochemical reaction calculations in reactive transport simulations. We demonstrate that even with a strong heterogeneity present, the ODML algorithm speeds up these calculations by one to three orders of magnitude. Such acceleration, in turn, significantly advances the entire reactive transport simulation. The performed numerical experiments are enabled by
              the novel coupling of two open-source software packages
              : Reaktoro (Leal 2015) and Firedrake (Rathgeber et al.

	abstract = {Abstract
            A domain specific language (DSL) focuses on the essential concepts in a specific problem domain, and abstracts from low-level implementation details. The development of DSLs usually centers around the meta-model, grammar and code generator, possibly extended with transformations to analysis models. Typically, little attention is given to the formal semantics of the language, whereas this is essential for reasoning about DSL models, and for assessing the correctness of the generated code and analysis models. We argue that the semantics of a DSL should be defined explicitly and independently of any code generator, to avoid all kinds of complexities from low-level implementation details. As the generated analysis models must reflect some of these implementation details, we propose to formalize them separately. To assess the correctness and consistency of the generated code and analysis models in a practical way, we use conformance testing. We extensively illustrate this general approach using specific formalizations for an industrial DSL on collision prevention. We do not aim for a generic semantic model for any DSL, but this specific DSL indicates the potential of a modular semantics to facilitate reuse among DSLs.},

Some agile methodologists consider that acceptance tests are more precise and accurate sources of information about the customer’s needs than descriptions in natural language. Several studies have addressed the use of acceptance tests as software requirements specification. Therefore, none of the previous studies has performed experiments to compare the applicability of different acceptance testing techniques in order to support an organization in the selection of one technique over another. This paper addresses this problem reporting an experiment conducted with undergraduate students in Computer Science. This experiment compares the applicability of two acceptance testing techniques (Fit tables and Gherkin language) as software requirements specification. This research tries to answer three questions: (a) Which technique is the easiest to learn in order to specify acceptance test scenarios? (b) Which technique requires less effort to specify acceptance tests? (c) Which technique is the best one to communicate software requirements? The results show that there is no sufficient evidence to affirm that one technique is easier to specify test scenarios or better to communicate software requirements. Whereas, the comparison of effort in terms of time to specify acceptance testing shows that the mean time to specify test scenarios using Gherkin language is lower than Fit tables.},

              We present an extensible software model for the genotype and phenotype community, XGAP. Readers can download a standard XGAP (
              http://www.xgap.org
              ) or auto-generate a custom version using MOLGENIS with programming interfaces to R-software and web-services or user interfaces for biologists. XGAP has simple load formats for any type of genotype, epigenotype, transcript, protein, metabolite or other phenotype data. Current functionality includes tools ranging from eQTL analysis in mouse to genome-wide association studies in humans.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Background
              The relation between vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and early luteal function has rarely been proven in humans. The purpose of this study was to define the relation between follicular fluid concentrations of VEGF (FF VEGF) and early luteal function at the preimplantation stage during assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycles.
            
            
              Methods
              71 women were divided into two groups, based on reproductive outcome: women who became pregnant after embryo transfer (ET) (n = 18, Group A) and non-pregnant women (n = 53, Group B). Serum progesterone (Se P) and inhibin A on ET day, and FF VEGF levels were measured in all women. Data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Statistical analysis was performed using Excel Office 98 for Student's t-test, linear regression test and chi-square test. A p value of {\textless} 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
            
            
              Results
              The groups were comparable for age, ovarian reserve, number and quality of the oocytes retrieved and of the embryos obtained and transferred. FF VEGF levels were increased (4235 ± 1433 vs 3432 ± 1231 pg/ml), while Se P and inhibin A levels were significantly reduced (83.1 ± 34.1 vs 112.0 ± 58.8 ng/ml and 397.4 ± 223 vs 533.5 ± 283 pg/ml, respectively) in the non-pregnant group and were negatively correlated with FF VEGF (r = -0.482, p {\textless} 0.05; r = -0.468, p {\textless} 0.05) only in pregnant women.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Much has to be learned about the regulation and role of VEGF during the early luteal phase. We advance the hypothesis that the existence of a negative correlation between FF VEGF/Se P and FF VEGF/inhibin A in pregnant women might indicate the existence of a normal VEGF-mediated paracrine response when Se P and inhibin A levels are decreased. Excess production of FF VEGF and the absence of a correlation between FF VEGF/Se P and FF VEGF/inhibin A in non-pregnant women may be a paracrine reaction to immature luteal vasculature, resulting in luteal dysfunction.},

              Background
              As anorexia and hypermetabolism are common in cirrhosis, leptin levels may be increased in this disease. In this study, we investigated the relation between the severity of disease and serum leptin levels in post-hepatitis cirrhosis and the role of body composition, gender and viral aetiology of cirrhosis in this association.
            
            
              Methods
              Thirty-five cases with post-hepatitis cirrhosis and 15 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. Body composition including body mass index, body fat percentage and body fat mass were determined. Serum leptin levels were assayed.
            
            
              Results
              Leptin levels were significantly higher among cirrhotic patients independent of sex compared to controls (p = 0.001). Female patients in both groups have had higher leptin levels than males (in cirrhotics p = 0.029, in controls p = 0.02).
              Cirrhotic patients in each of A, B and C subgroups according to the Child- Pugh classification revealed significantly different levels compared to controls (p = 0.046, p = 0.004, p = 0.0001, respectively). Male cirrhotics in Child-Pugh Class B and C subgroups had significantly higher leptin levels compared to male controls (p = 0.006, p = 0.008). On the other hand, female patients only in Child Pugh class C subgroup have had higher levels of serum leptin compared to controls (p = 0.022).
              Child-Pugh classification has been found to be the sole discriminator in determination of leptin levels in cirrhotics by linear regression (beta: 0.435 p = 0.015).
            
            
              Conclusion
              Serum leptin levels increase in advanced liver disease independently of gender, body composition in posthepatitic cirrhosis. The increase is more abundant among patients that belong to C subgroup according to the Child- Pugh classification.},
